            <description>I'm closely watching (as always) USDMXN for clues on a turn in risk sentiment.  Conventional wisdom says that the debt deal resolution is bullish so it probably marks a short term top in risk sentiment rather than a  point of acceleration.NZDUSD is above .8500 and 800 pips higher than where it was on August 30th!  Levels of interest as resistance are the February high at .8533, the 5/6 high at .8555 and the 4/30 high at .8585.</description>

            <description>After half a decade, the massive U.S. housing crisis is officially over.Pricing and demand for homes are improving, banks are no longer saddled with billions in sour loans, and shares of many homebuilders are trading far up from their generational lows seen in 2008 and 2009.Â So should investors prepare for a housing boom in coming years? If so, that would make this a great time to buy homebuilding stocks, which have recently cooled off after multi-year gains.</description>
