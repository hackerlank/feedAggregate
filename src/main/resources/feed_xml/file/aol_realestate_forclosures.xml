<br />
The number of distressed properties last month decreased 27 percent from September 2012, with a little less than 1.3 million properties in some stage of foreclosure (default, auction or bank owned). That's one in every 998 <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/10/whats-the-worst-kind-of-debt/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_1&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="What's the Worst Kind of Debt?">homes in foreclosure</a> across the nation. Data from real estate site <a href="http://www.realtytrac.com/statsandtrends">RealtyTrac</a> showed that while foreclosures were up 2 percent from August, filings have continued to fall over the course of this past year. Prices of those foreclosed homes have also declined, in conjunction with rising values of non-distressed properties, resulting in a more significant discount.<br />
<br />
In August, the most recent sales data available on RealtyTrac, the discount on <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/04/a-foreclosure-is-killing-my-credit-what-do-i-do/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="A Foreclosure Is Killing My Credit, What Do I Do?">foreclosed homes</a> was 39.5 percent, or an average of $73,900. That's an increased discount of $3,900 (5.6 percent) from last year, at a median sale price of $113,000. The median sale price for a non-distressed property in August was $186,900.<br />
<br />
But the news isn't good everywhere.<a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/09/credit-mistakes-retirement/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_4&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="7 Credit Mistakes That Could Wreck Your Retirement"> Foreclosure activity</a> spiked 104 percent in Nevada from July to August, as it overtook <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/08/florida-still-the-top-foreclosure-state/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_5&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="Florida: Still the Top Foreclosure State">Florida</a> as the state with the most foreclosures. It remained on top in September with activity increasing 44 percent from August. With 1 in every 249 properties in foreclosure, Nevada's foreclosure rate is up 97 percent from September 2012.<br />
<br />
Florida, Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey join Nevada as the five states with the highest <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/08/repo-men-clear-out-the-wrong-house/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_6&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="When Repo Men Clear Out the Wrong House">foreclosure rates</a>. In June, 1 in every 328 Florida homes had a foreclosure filing, and the rate has declined to 1 in 406 in September.<br />

Nearly a decade after moving to a hotel after losing her home in foreclosure, a Wisconsin woman faces eviction for an unpaid bill of $29,000. Jana Ganjian says that her poor health put her out of a job and then her home, and that she's only stayed at the hotel all this time because she was unable to find a place to rent.<br />
<br />
"I had no vision of staying for nine and a half years," Ganjian told Milwaukee TV station <a href="http://www.wisn.com/news/south-east-wisconsin/racine-kenosha/racine-woman-facing-eviction-after-living-in-hotel-for-9-years/-/10151828/22419422/-/tt7lak/-/index.html?absolute=true&amp;flv=1" target="_blank">WISN</a>, "but with no family, no longer with a home, the hotel became home and the staff became family." <a href="http://journaltimes.com/news/local/nine-years-at-the-marriott/article_8bb14d0c-32cf-11e3-a3ec-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">The Journal Times of Racine</a> quoted her as saying that she's disabled by a disease similar to lupus and "If I could be working, this wouldn't have happened in the first place."<br />
<br />

Ganjian reportedly has been paying $89 a day, with the help of Social Security disability benefits, to stay at the Racine Marriott in Mount Pleasant, but the hotel sought to evict her after she filed for bankruptcy in August. Ganjian said that although she reached the highest level under Marriott's rewards points program, she wasn't allowed to apply those points to her stay. A judge ruled last week that Ganjian must leave the hotel by Oct. 24.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/viewart/20131012/GPG0101/310120376/?flv=1" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a> said that it was unclear how Ganjian managed to stay long enough to accrue such a large bill at the hotel, and that the hotel's general manager, Brian Wismar, declined to discuss Ganjian's situation, as a matter of customer privacy. As seen in the video above, Ganjian's attorney (pictured) says it's also unclear where his client will go after she must leave the Marriott.<br />

<em>By ALEX VEIGA</em><br />
<br />
LOS ANGELES -- The number of U.S. homes set on the path to foreclosure slid to a seven-year low in the third quarter, reflecting a gradually improving housing market and fewer homeowners falling behind on mortgage payments.<br />
<br />
Lenders initiated foreclosure action on 174,366 homes in the July-September period, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2006, <a href="http://www.realtytrac.com/" target="_blank">foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac Inc. said Thursday</a>.<br />
<br />
Foreclosure starts declined 13 percent from the previous quarter and were down 39 percent from the third quarter last year, the firm said.<br />
<br />
The national slowdown in foreclosure starts comes as the U.S. <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/housing+market/" target="_blank">housing market</a> continues to recover from a deep slump, a rebound driven by rising home prices, steady job growth and fewer troubled loans dating back to the housing bubble days. Fewer homes entering the foreclosure pipeline should translate into fewer properties that eventually end up lost to foreclosure.<br />
<br />
"It's looking really good that there are not more coming into the pipeline," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac. "Barring any other economic shock to the system, we expect that to bode well going forward."<br />
<br />
Foreclosure starts fell on an annual basis in the third quarter in 38 states, including Colorado, Arizona, California and Illinois. They increased from a year earlier in 11 states, including Maryland, Oregon, New Jersey and Connecticut.<br />
<br />
While fewer homes are entering the <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/foreclosures/" target="_blank">foreclosure</a> process, lenders stepped up home repossessions, which led to a quarterly increase in homes lost to foreclosure.<br />
<br />
Completed foreclosures rose 7 percent in the third quarter versus the April-June period, the firm said. Completed foreclosures were down 24 percent from the third quarter last year, however.<br />
<br />
All told, 119,485 homes were taken back by lenders in the July-September quarter. That puts the nation on pace to end this year with roughly 507,497 completed foreclosures, or down about 24 percent from 2012's total.<br />
<br />
Foreclosures peaked in 2010 at 1.05 million and have been declining ever since.<br />
<br />
The number of homes taken back by banks in the third quarter climbed from the previous quarter in 26 states, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Virginia, RealtyTrac said.<br />
<br />
Much of the quarterly increase in foreclosures came about in states where courts oversee the foreclosure process. Those courts were backed up with cases two years ago, but have been making progress working through their backlog.<br />
<br />
Even so, it's taking longer for homes in many states to complete the foreclosure process.<br />
<br />
In the third quarter, it took an average of 551 days, or 1.5 years, for a U.S. home to move from initial default status to ultimately being repossessed by the lender, the firm said.<br />
<br />
That's up from an average of 526 days in the second quarter and an increase from 382 days in the third quarter of last year.<br />
<br />
"It's a sign that we're still dealing with the wreckage of the last housing bust," Blomquist said.<br />
<br />
In New York, it took an average of 1,037 days, or nearly three years, for the foreclosure process to run its course in the third quarter, the longest of any state. Maine clocked the shortest average time to foreclose at 160 days.<br />
<br />
The impact of foreclosures remains sharply elevated in some states. Florida topped the nation with a foreclosure rate of more than twice the national average in the third quarter.<br />
<br />
Rounding out the top 10 states with the highest foreclosure rates in the July-September period were: Nevada, Maryland, Illinois, Ohio, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, Indiana and South Carolina.<br />

Chicago wants <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/renters-rules/">renters</a> to be able to keep living in buildings that have fallen into default or be paid thousands for their pains. A new law designed to protect renters from suddenly losing their homes because of foreclosure just took effect this week in <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/rental-listings?loc=Chicago,%20IL">Chicago</a>, with the hope that it will also stem a tide of <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/vacant+homes/">vacant and derelict dwellings</a> that have afflicted that city and many others in the wake of the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/housing+crisis/">housing crisis</a>. The ordinance, called "<a href="https://chicago.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1156573&amp;GUID=4F709387-96EE-4BD0-9950-C692DE714378&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search">Keep Chicago Renting</a>," requires that a renter of a foreclosed property be paid $10,600 to relocate or be granted a rent-controlled lease until that property is sold.<br />
<br />
In 2010, AOL Real Estate reported that the occupants of more than 8,500 rental units in Chicago were pushed out by foreclosures in 2009. Along with losing their homes, it was estimated then that it <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2010/04/29/foreclosed-on-chicago-renters-get-deposits-back/">cost Chicago's renters $7.3 million</a> in lost security deposits. The situation then got even worse, with "banks systematically empty foreclosed buildings, leaving them vacant for months or years," according to the <a href="http://lcbh.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2012-LCBH-Foreclosure-Report.pdf">Lawyers' Committee for Better Housing</a> (which <a href="http://about.bloomberglaw.com/law-reports/chicago-requires-relocation-assistance-for-tenants-affected-by-foreclosures/">Bloomberg Law</a> described as a primary force behind the Chicago ordinance). Chicago radio station <a href="http://www.wbez.org/news/protections-renters-foreclosed-buildings-take-effect-108756">WBEZ</a> cited committee figures for 2012 that said there were 4,346 foreclosures on Chicago apartment buildings that affected 11,932 rental units.<br />
<br />
In a story that year about the impact of vacant properties on neighboring homes and whole neighborhoods, the executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago described to AOL Real Estate how they were <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2012/09/21/vacant-homes-plague-neighbors-as-banks-sit-on-their-hands/">pushing other homes toward foreclosure</a> and worse. "They become magnets of crime," Ed Jacob said of the vacant properties. "They'll get stripped of all their copper. People use them to stash their drugs. It's a huge psychological effect on homeowners who are hanging on." The Lawyers Committee said criminal activity in such buildings rose 48 percent in seven years.<br />
<br />
Banks, landlords and real estate agents opposing the "Keep Chicago Renting" ordinance warned that it would only aggravate the problems it's designed to relieve. "It's going to be a disincentive for investment in multi-units from a wide range of financing sources," Brian Bernardoni, senior director of government affairs and public policy of the <a href="http://www.illinoisrealtor.org/">Illinois Association of Realtors</a> was quoted by WBEZ as saying. "Any time you have a lack of investment, there's going to be a lack of rehab, a lack of sustainable affordable housing and preservation of affordable housing units."<br />

While <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2013/03/05/100-abandoned-houses-detroit-bankruptcy/">many were flocking from Detroit</a>, leaving abandoned homes and distressed neighborhoods in their wake, Laura Breisch was house hunting.<br />
<br />
A faithful Motor City denizen, Breisch started looking for a new place two years ago, after a divorce forced her from the Detroit suburb she had called home for nearly a decade. She began her search on <a href="http://whydontweownthis.com/#11/42.3530/-83.0992">Why Don't We Own This?</a>, a site that maps the city's <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/foreclosures/">foreclosed houses</a> that are up for <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/auction/">auction</a>.<br />
<br />
Breisch had her work cut out for her. With a huge directory of homes to comb through, she began to scope out the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Detroit/">Detroit</a> neighborhood that she wanted to live in. "I didn't want to be in the one house standing amongst a bunch of burnt-out houses," she said.<br />
<br />
Breisch's perseverance eventually paid off. After narrowing the list down to just three, she walked away from an auction with keys to a huge home with an inviting porch and fireplace. But Breisch still had a long way to go to make the house livable.<br />

NEW YORK -- There were fewer U.S. foreclosures in July than a year ago, while properties in the foreclosure pipeline also fell as the housing market continued to improve, according to data from CoreLogic.<br />
<br />
There were 49,000 completed <a href="http://dailyfinance.com/tag/foreclosures/" target="_blank">foreclosures</a> last month, down from a 65,000 in July of last year, CoreLogic (<a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/quote/nyse/corelogic/clgx" target="_blank">CLGX</a>) said Thursday. There were 53,000 foreclosures in June, down from an originally reported 55,000.<br />
<br />
Before the housing market's downturn in 2007, completed foreclosures averaged 21,000 a month between 2000 and 2006. Since the financial crisis began in September 2008, there have been about 4.5 million foreclosures.<br />
<br />
Foreclosures are completed when a home is either seized by the lender or sold at auction. During the past 18 months, the <a href="http://dailyfinance.com/tag/housing+market/" target="_blank">housing market</a> has recovered its footing as prices and sales increased, and foreclosures slowed.

<div id="inContent" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);"><span>Sponsored Links</span><script>adsonar_placementId=1505951;adsonar_pid=1990767;adsonar_ps=-1;adsonar_zw=242;adsonar_zh=252;adsonar_jv='ads.tw.adsonar.com';</script> <script src="http://js.adsonar.com/js/tw_dfp_adsonar.js"></script></div>
<br />
<br />
A recent spike in borrowing costs, however, has slowed new mortgage applications and demand to refinance existing loans. If that persists, it could result in fewer foreclosure resales.<br />
<br />
"If demand is a little bit lower, it might slow down a bit the pace of decline in foreclosure inventories," said Mark Fleming, chief economist for CoreLogic. "But of all the housing types in demand, stressed assets are a hot commodity and are often bought by cash investors who are less sensitive to mortgage rates."<br />
<br />
There were about 949,000 homes in some stage of foreclosure, down from 1.4 million a year ago. That foreclosure inventory represented 2.4 percent of all mortgaged homes, down from 3.4 percent in July last year.<br />
<br />
The five states with the highest foreclosures in the year leading up to July were Florida, California, Michigan, Texas and Georgia, which together accounted for almost half of all foreclosures.<br />
<br />
Florida also had the highest percentage of homes sitting in foreclosure, followed by New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Maine.<br />

You'd like to think that if someone broke into your home, then backed up a truck and carted away all your worldly possessions, that they could be found criminally guilty of something. But that's not the case for Nikki Bailey of Logan, W.Va., who came home from visiting a friend in the hospital to find that all of her belongings had been taken in a foreclosure repossession, even though her home had long ago been paid off.<br />
<br />
<img data-mep="4814" src="http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/adam/22926552a0252d57239533f6c7657bdf/nikki bailey wsaz newzy.JPG" style="float: left;" alt="" />As described in the video above, the repossession was supposed to have taken place at an address with a similar street name -- but in another town. The mistake wasn't discovered until Bailey caught the repossession crew finishing up at her house, and by that time, they said, the former teacher's clothes, furniture and keepsakes had already been disposed of at a dump. Bailey's next step is to seek some kind of civil action against the repossessing company, CTM Industries, or the bank that employed them, as yet unidentified.<br />
<br />
Whether viewed as a simple mistake or reckless negligence, the same thing happened to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/ohio-bank-forecloses-wrong-home-katie-barnett_n_3644246.html">woman in neighboring Ohio</a> in a widely publicized incident just last month. The foreclosing bank there blamed a faulty GPS and offered restitution for the thousands in losses that the homeowner suffered if, it said, she could provide receipts for the items. In 2012 a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wells-fargo-mistakes-home-neighboring-foreclosed-home/story?id=17185239">home in Twentynine Palms, Calif.</a>, also was mistakenly broken into and had contents removed by repo contractors -- in that case, twice. The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/bank-contractors-break-ins_n_1682672.html">Huffington Post</a> reports court records as showing that at least 50 lawsuits have been filed in recent years alleging similar mistaken break-ins.<br />

<br />
Not all is lost for a Pennsylvania woman who lost her $280,000 home over an unpaid $6 interest charge. A Beaver County appeals court has vacated a ruling in a case against homeowner Eileen Battisti, saying the trial court acted too hastily when it denied Battisti a proper hearing to prevent her home (pictured above) from being sold at auction two years ago.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/realestate.aol.com/blog/media/2013/08/eileen-battistioriginal-1.jpg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 4px; float: left;" />"This was particularly inappropriate because the outstanding liability was small and the value of the home was far greater than the amount paid by (the) purchaser," <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Commonwealth/out/1079CD12_8-19-13.pdf?cb=1">Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt wrote</a> for the court.<br />
<br />
No kidding. Battisti (pictured at left) owed just $6.30 in unpaid interest charges on a 2009 tax bill, which by 2011 had grown to $235 with interest. She claimed she didn't know about the past due charge until she was notified that her home was about to be auctioned off by the county. By then it was too late, and the house was sold for $116,000 to S.P. Lewis of Imperial.<br />
<br />
With the court's ruling this week, she's lucky to have another shot at saving her home.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, cases like Battisti's are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/state-predatory-tax-liens-practices-could-destabilize-entire-communities-2012-7">not uncommon</a>, as state and municipal tax offices scramble to fill budget holes by aggressively pursuing unpaid property taxes -- even if it means auctioning off homes over a few bucks.<br />
<br />
As a result, annual tax lien sales have topped $15 billion per year, according to a report released by the <a href="http://www.nclc.org/images/pdf/foreclosure_mortgage/tax_issues/tax-lien-sales-report.pdf" target="_blank">National Consumer Law Center</a> last year.<br />
<br />
For investors, tax lien sales are nothing less than a gold mine. Big purchasers -- for example, debt collectors or large retail banks - can snap up the properties at deeply discounted rates and then sell them at a ridiculous profit.<br />
<br />
"Homeowners throughout the nation, particularly the elderly and people with cognitive challenges, have lost or stand to lose family homes along with long-term equity which may represent their sole savings and security for retirement," NCLC Attorney John Rao previously told BI.<br />

<em>By ALEX VEIGA</em><br />
<br />
LOS ANGELES -- The U.S. is on track to end the year with the fewest homes repossessed by lenders in six years, a trend that should help limit the negative impact foreclosures have on home values.<br />
<br />
Lenders repossessed 36,964 U.S. homes last month, down 31 percent from July last year, <a href="http://www.realtytrac.com/" target="_blank">foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac said Thursday</a>.<br />
<br />
At the monthly average pace through July, completed <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/foreclosures/" target="_blank">foreclosures</a> are projected to total nearly 490,000 this year, down roughly 27 percent from last year, the firm said. That's also the lowest since 2007, when 404,849 homes were taken back by banks.<br />
<br />
Foreclosures peaked in 2010 at 1.05 million and have been declining ever since. The trend has been accelerating as U.S. home prices have increased amid a resurgent <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/housing+market/" target="_blank">housing market</a>, steady job gains and still-low mortgage interest rates.

<div id="inContent" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);"><span>Sponsored Links</span><script>adsonar_placementId=1505951;adsonar_pid=1990767;adsonar_ps=-1;adsonar_zw=242;adsonar_zh=252;adsonar_jv='ads.tw.adsonar.com';</script> <script src="http://js.adsonar.com/js/tw_dfp_adsonar.js"></script></div>
<br />
<br />
The foreclosure pipeline is also getting thinner on the front end.<br />
<br />
Lenders initiated the foreclosure process on 60,601 homes in July, down 38 percent from a year earlier, RealtyTrac said.<br />
<br />
Foreclosure starts and the number of homes repossessed by banks each increased 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, from June. But annual increases, which are more telling of the long-term trend, occurred in less than half of the states.<br />
<br />
"The most visible sign of distress in the market are foreclosures, and many of these markets have the foreclosure problem licked, for the most part," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.<br />
<br />
In a dozen states, including Texas, Colorado, Michigan and Indiana, foreclosure activity levels were at or below the average monthly levels last seen before the housing crash, Blomquist added.<br />
<br />
"We expect the number of states in this category to increase in the coming months," he said.<br />
<br />
Among the 15 states that posted sharp annual increases last month in foreclosure starts are:
<ul>
	<li>Maryland -- 275%</li>
	<li>Oregon -- 137%</li>
	<li>New York -- 27%</li>
</ul>
Completed foreclosures rose on an annual basis in 18 states last month, including:

<ul>
	<li>Arkansas -- 266%</li>
	<li>Oklahoma -- 126%</li>
	<li>New York -- 100%</li>
	<li>Ohio -- 20%</li>
</ul>
Many homeowners in those states and elsewhere continue to owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, a scenario known as having negative equity. Homeowners with negative equity can be more vulnerable to foreclosure should they fall behind on their mortgage payments.<br />
<br />
Some 9.7 million homes, or 19.8 percent of all U.S. homes with a mortgage, were in negative equity at the end of the first quarter, according to data provider CoreLogic. That's down from 10.5 million, or 21.7 percent of homes with a mortgage, at the end of last year.<br />
<br />
In a healthy housing market, underwater mortgages historically account for about 5 percent of all homes with a mortgage.<br />
<br />
Most of the homes in some stage of foreclosure as of July are tied to home loans that were made during the housing boom, before banks tightened their lending standards.<br />
<br />
Of the 562,533 homes already on the foreclosure path, 71 percent have loans that were originated between 2004 and 2008, the firm said.<br />
<br />
In Florida, nearly 80 percent of the homes in the foreclosure process have loans that date back to the housing bubble years. That's one reason the state registered the highest foreclosure rate of any state last month, or more than three times the national average, RealtyTrac said.<br />
<br />
The state's foreclosure starts decreased 28 percent from a year earlier, but completed foreclosures jumped 13 percent.<br />
<br />
Rounding out the top 10 states by foreclosure rate last month were Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut, New Mexico, Illinois, Nevada, Georgia, South Carolina and Utah.<br />

The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in a Northern California court by mortgage bond trustees Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank on behalf of an investor group that includes Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO, BlackRock Inc. and DoubleLine Capital LP.<br />
<br />
The Northern California city recently sent notice to the holders of more than 620 so-called <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/underwater+mortgages/">underwater home mortgages</a> in the city, asking them to sell the loans to the city. It would buy the mortgages for 80 percent of the fair value of the homes, write them down and help the homeowners refinance their loans.<br />
<br />
The investor group said if the city of Richmond is allowed to go ahead with its plan it may result in steeper down payment requirements and higher interest rates.<br />
<br />
"The purpose of the lawsuit is to protect retirees and savers from an unlawful and unconstitutional seizure of private property and prevent severe damage to the country's home mortgage market," the investor group said in its filing. Ropes &amp; Gray LLP, the law firm representing the institutional investor group, uploaded a copy of the filing on its website. The filing is not yet available on the court website.<br />
<br />
Richmond is working with San Francisco-based Mortgage Resolution Partners, a private investment firm that has been pitching the plan to U.S cities and municipalities for more than a year. MRP, raising money from private sources, would work with the city to obtain the financing to buy the distressed mortgages and restructure them. MRP would receive a fee for every troubled loan it restructured under the plan.<br />
<br />
The investor group said in its filing that the program is a profit-driven strategy designed to enrich Richmond, MRP and its financial backers. "Such a program does not involve a legitimate 'public use' for which the government's eminent domain power is expressly reserved," the group said.<br />
<br />
The institutional group requested the court to prevent Richmond from going ahead with its program and declare its plan to seize mortgages as unconstitutional. "MRP has reviewed the lawsuit and is confident that it is without merit. The actions of the city of Richmond and MRP are entirely within the law, and any loan purchase will be at fair value. No investor in any trust will be made worse off by the sale of any loan," MRP chairman Steven Gluckstern said in a statement issued to Reuters.<br />
<br />
The case is in re Institutional Investor group vs City Of Richmond, California and Mortgage Resolution Partners LLC, Case No. 13-3663, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California.<br />

<br />
Losing one's home <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2012/03/foreclosure-can-chew-300-points-off-your-credit-score/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_1&amp;utm_campaign=taxes_foreclosed_home">to foreclosure</a> is never easy. A reader, "Kate," wants to know whether she will still be on the hook for her property tax bill if it gets to that point.<br />
<br />
She writes: <em>"If one "walks away" from their home mortgage, home goes to foreclosure, but still owed a current property tax due on that home, does the bank pay the tax lien (bill) when the house sells again? Or can the local county come after the old owner?"</em><br />
<br />
Whether or not you will be responsible for the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/property+taxes/">property taxes</a> owed depends in part on where you live. In Florida, for example, "The liability follows the property, not the owner," says Jo Ann Koontz, an attorney and CPA with Koontz and Associates. When the lender forecloses, the "property tax is paid by the lender in the foreclosure sale. They can't wait until the bank sells to the next buyer; it has to be paid at the auction," she explains. But in other states, that may not be the case, warns Eugene Melchionne, a Connecticut bankruptcy attorney.<br />
<br />
He elaborates: "Some states do not require an auction as part of a foreclosure. Connecticut and Vermont are examples of this. When the foreclosure completes, the bank may become the owner of the property, but there is no absolute requirement that the taxes which attach to the property be paid at that time. As a result, some municipalities are suffering from declines in tax collection as the lenders fail to pay the taxes timely.<br />
<br />
"While the personal liability for the future taxes is cut off with the completion of the foreclosure, personal liability for the past taxes remains unless there is a bankruptcy discharge. Therefore, some municipalities can issue a tax warrant for collection against former owners (because they are local and thus easily reached) to collect the old taxes while letting the current taxes accrue. Since the time to collect property taxes can be quite extended (15 years in Connecticut) unless there is an absolute need for cash, a municipality may elect to sit on the taxes for a while.<br />
<br />
"In Connecticut, taxes bear interest at the rate of 18 percent annually so it can be considered quite the investment. You might call this 'Zombie Tax Debt' as opposed to debt coming from a Zombie Deed."<br />
<br />
In addition, it's important for homeowners to understand that when they <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2011/07/underwater-on-your-home-your-six-options/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_2&amp;utm_campaign=taxes_foreclosed_home">walk away from their homes</a>, lenders sometime leave those properties in limbo and fail to actually foreclose. During that time, the homeowner remains the owner of record and remains <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2011/06/keeping-banks-honest-protect-yourself-during-foreclosure/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;utm_campaign=taxes_foreclosed_home">responsible for certain expenses</a>. For example, "Homeowner association dues continue to be the liability of the property owner if the foreclosure doesn't happen or is substantially delayed," Koontz points out.<br />
<br />
There's more to consider. Even though the homeowner may not be living in the property anymore, it's important to make sure that liability insurance is still in place in case of an accident on the property. And not to be alarmist, but in some jurisdictions of the country, the owner may be criminally liable for failing to maintain a home to code!<br />
<br />
Other <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2011/12/ask-the-credit-experts-should-i-walk-away-from-my-home/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_4&amp;utm_campaign=taxes_foreclosed_home">risks of walking away</a> include the fact that the lender may be able to try to collect a deficiency for several years, depending on state law and whether the loan was a recourse or non-recourse loan. Plus, there could be a hefty tax bill for canceled debt for those who don't qualify for an exclusion, such as the one offered under the <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2011/03/1099-c-in-the-mail-how-to-avoid-taxes-on-cancelled-debt/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_5&amp;utm_campaign=taxes_foreclosed_home">Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act</a>.<br />
<br />
In other words, it's not as simple as just saying, "Take the house, I don't want it anymore." That's why someone who is unable to keep up with their house payments might want to <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2012/06/underwater-homeowners-ask-should-i-stay-or-should-i-go/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_6&amp;utm_campaign=taxes_foreclosed_home">get professional advice</a> from a real estate and/or bankruptcy attorney, and to talk with a tax professional as well.<br />
<br />
It may feel like throwing good money after bad, but failing to get expert advice could literally cost you tens of thousands of dollars down the road.<br />

NEW YORK -- U.S. home foreclosure filings tumbled in June to a 6&amp;frac12;-year low, a further sign the housing market is getting back on better footing, <a href="http://www.realtytrac.com/" target="_blank">a report from RealtyTrac showed Thursday</a>.<br />
<br />
Overall, 127,790 properties had foreclosure filings last month, down 14 percent from May, and down 35 percent from a year earlier. It was the lowest level since December 2006.<br />
<br />
There were also fewer homes entering the foreclosure process, while lenders seized less <a href="http://dailyfinance.com/tag/home/" target="_blank">homes</a>. In the first six months of the year, banks took over 248,538 homes, putting repossessions on track for about 500,000 for the year, which would be down from the over 671,000 seen last year.<br />
<br />
"We are getting tantalizingly close to being back to normal, healthy foreclosure levels, at least on a nationwide basis," said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac.<br />
<br />
Repossessions were down in 34 states in June from a year ago, though some states saw significant increases, including Arkansas, Oklahoma and Maryland.
<div id="inContent" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);"><span>Sponsored Links</span><script>adsonar_placementId=1505951;adsonar_pid=1990767;adsonar_ps=-1;adsonar_zw=242;adsonar_zh=252;adsonar_jv='ads.tw.adsonar.com';</script> <script src="http://js.adsonar.com/js/tw_dfp_adsonar.js"></script></div>
<br />
<br />
The housing market has gotten back on its feet in the last year with home prices rising and sales improving. Fewer foreclosures have also helped the sector heal and improved homebuyer confidence.<br />
<br />
States that process <a href="http://dailyfinance.com/tag/foreclosures/" target="_blank">foreclosures</a> through the court system, known as judicial states, appeared to be loosening the logjam of pending cases that has plagued the market.<br />
<br />
Judicial foreclosure auctions were scheduled for 28,296 properties in June, up less than 1 percent from May but a jump of 34 percent from last year.<br />
<br />
Some of the states with the biggest yearly increases in scheduled auctions are also states that have struggled the most with a backed-up pipeline of distressed homes, including New Jersey, Florida and New York.<br />
<br />
Still, the time it takes to foreclose continued to lengthen. Properties foreclosed in the second quarter took an average 526 days to foreclose, up from 577 days in the first quarter.<br />
<br />
"Once that number turns the corner and starts going down, that will be a strong indication that the lenders and courts have worked through the backlog and now we're just dealing with the fresher vintage of foreclosures," Blomquist said.<br />
<br />
Foreclosure times were the longest in New York and New Jersey, with both states taking 1,033 days.<br />
<br />
Hard-hit Florida had the highest foreclosure rate in the first half of the year, with a foreclosure filing on 1.7 percent of homes, or one in every 58. That's nearly three times the national average of one in every 164 homes.<br />

<br />
Alleged thieves apparently broke in to a foreclosure home in north St. Louis, changed the locks so that they had keys to the house, forged ownership papers, and then rented the place out to an unsuspecting family. Police have charged suspects Winston Clay and Todd Edwards with forgery and stealing.<br />
<br />
Renter Bertha Williams thought the rental home "was legit" because Clay and Edwards had keys to the front door. Plus they advertised and listed it for rent at $650/month. For six months Clay and Edwards collected the rent -- nearly $4,000 in all -- until the real owner, <a href="http://revenue.stlouisco.com/">Tracy Franklin</a>, who had been living out of town during the foreclosure process, checked on the house (pictured above) while back in St. Louis, <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Thieves-collect-thousands-in-rent-after-leasing-north-St-Louis-home-illegally-215142861.html">reported local TV station KMOV</a>.<br />
<br />
Williams and co-renter Dwayne Ellis will have to find another place to live, while Clay makes another visit to the police station. AOL Real Estate found that Clay has other arrests under his belt during this past 12 months, including possession of <a href="http://www.bustedmugshots.com/missouri/st-louis/winston-b-clay/58650371">drug paraphernelia</a>, <a href="http://www.bustedmugshots.com/missouri/st-louis/winston-b-clay/114869281">domestic assault</a> and <a href="http://www.mugshotsonline.com/missouri/st-louis/winston-b-clay/64651661">failure to register a vehicle</a>.<br />
<br />
Ellis says that, the next time, he and Williams will do research on the Internet to determine if the owners are who they say they are.<br />
<br />
In another foreclosure-related case, a woman in Virginia was also too trusting of her landlord who apparently leased to her a home that was already in foreclosure. Courtney Gourgoulianis and her two-year-old daughter were evicted from their rental house in <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.285714149475098px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Virginia Beach </span>on Monday, only days after moving in, <a href="http://wtkr.com/2013/07/10/woman-caught-up-in-housing-nightmare-reaches-out-to-newschannel-3/">reported WTKR</a> in Norfolk, Va. The owner of the house hasn't been around and the leasing agency is not getting back to her.<br />
<br />
"I shouldn't have to suffer the consequences of someone else's crap," says Gourgoulianis. And she's right. Renters of foreclosures do have some legal rights against eviction due to foreclosure.<br />
<br />
But it's even better to be proactive by researching the landlord. Check county property or tax assessor websites to find out who the owner of a home really and be forthright enough to ask to see recent mortgage statements.<br />

<br />
LOS ANGELES -- Fewer U.S. homes entered the foreclosure process or were repossessed by banks in June, the latest sign that the nation is shaking off its housing bust hangover.<br />
<br />
Lenders initiated the foreclosure process on 57,286 homes last month, the lowest level for any month in 7&amp;frac12; years, <a href="http://www.realtytrac.com/content/foreclosure-market-report/us-foreclosure-activity-decreases-14-percent-in-june-to-lowest-level-since-december-2006-despite-34-percent-jump-in-judicial-scheduled-foreclosure-auctions-7794?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foreclosure-market-report-rss-feed+%28RealtyTrac+Foreclosure+Market+Report%29" target="_blank">foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac Inc. said Thursday</a>.<br />
<br />
Foreclosure starts are on pace to reach roughly 800,000 this year, down from 1.1 million last year, the firm said.<br />
<br />
Completed <a href="http://dailyfinance.com/tag/foreclosures/" target="_blank">foreclosures</a>, when the lender repossesses a home, are on track to hit a half-million, or about a quarter below last year's total.<br />
<br />
The trend comes as the U.S. housing recovery continues to gain strength, propelled by steady job gains, low <a href="http://dailyfinance.com/tag/interest+rates/" target="_blank">interest rates</a>, improving consumer confidence and growing demand for homes at a time when there's a thin supply of available homes for sale in many markets.<br />
<br />
That's helped boost home prices, which jumped 12.2 percent in May from a year earlier -- the biggest gain in seven years, according to data provider CoreLogic.<br />
<br />
Even so, foreclosures remain a potential drag on housing in many states, including Florida, Nevada, Illinois and Ohio.<br />
<br />
"Halfway through 2013, it is becoming increasingly evident that while foreclosures are no longer a national problem, they continue to be a state and local market problem," said Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac.<br />
<br />
Homes scheduled for auction in states like Florida, where the courts play a role in the foreclosure process, were up 34 percent in June from a year earlier, the firm said.<br />
<br />
Scheduled home auctions doubled last month in New Jersey and Florida, which also posted the highest foreclosure rate of any state -- nearly three times the national average -- in the first six months of the year, the firm said.
<div id="inContent" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);"><span>Sponsored Links</span><script>adsonar_placementId=1505951;adsonar_pid=1990767;adsonar_ps=-1;adsonar_zw=242;adsonar_zh=252;adsonar_jv='ads.tw.adsonar.com';</script> <script src="http://js.adsonar.com/js/tw_dfp_adsonar.js"></script></div>
<br />
<br />
Most homes lined up for public auction typically end up going back to lenders, which opens the door for the properties to be placed on the market as sharply discounted foreclosed homes later this year or in 2013.<br />
<br />
Nationally, the inventory of previously occupied homes on the market was 10 percent below prior-year levels in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. So the potential for more foreclosures going on sale will likely be welcome news to would-be homebuyers in markets where there is a tight supply of available homes.<br />
<br />
The number of homes that entered the foreclosure process in June was down 21 percent from May and about 45 percent below June 2012's total.<br />
<br />
Lenders repossessed 35,507 homes last month, down nearly 9 percent from May and a drop of 35 percent from a year earlier. That's still short of the 25,000 or so a month that Blomquist considers the benchmark for foreclosures in a "normal" housing market.<br />
<br />
At the height of the housing boom in 2006, completed foreclosures averaged 22,000 a month. They peaked in September 2010 at 102,000. Tighter lending standards for home loans since the housing bubble burst have helped slow the pace of foreclosures.<br />
<br />
About 75 percent of the 824,292 U.S. homes in the foreclosure process as of June are tied to loans that were originated between 2004 and 2008.<br />
<br />
"That's a good sign that the lending has much improved and we're not seeing high foreclosure rates on mortgages that have been taken out since 2008," Blomquist said.<br />

<br />
Fewer U.S. foreclosures were completed in May compared with a year ago, while the number of houses in the foreclosure process also declined as the market continued to heal, data analysis firm CoreLogic said on Tuesday. <span style="font-size: 14px;">There were 52,000 foreclosures completed, well below the 71,000 in May last year, the analytics company said. Even so, that was up from 50,000 in April 2013.</span><br />
<br />
Prior to the housing market's collapse, completed foreclosures averaged 21,000 a month between 2000 and 2006. There have been approximately 4.4 million foreclosures finished since the start of the financial crisis in September 2008, the report said. <span style="font-size: 14px;">Foreclosures are completed when a home is either seized by the lender or sold at auction.</span><br />
<br />
About 1 million homes were in some stage of foreclosure as of May, down from 1.4 million a year earlier. The foreclosure inventory accounts for 2.6 percent of all homes with a mortgage. <span style="font-size: 14px;">Florida had the largest number of foreclosures in the 12 months ending in May, followed by California, Michigan, Texas and Georgia. Those five states accounted for almost half of all completed foreclosures.</span><br />
<br />
Florida, which was hit hard by the housing crisis, also had the highest percentage of foreclosure inventory. The top five was rounded out by New Jersey, New York, Maine and Connecticut.<br />

Salcedo's dream of getting a home there came closer to a reality when she was selected as one of eight winners in a city redevelopment project. The "<a href="http://www.wbng.com/news/local/City-of-Binghamton-announces-winners-of-One-Dollar-Healty-Homes-initiative-208136191.html">One Dollar Healthy Homes" initiative</a> sold vacant and abandoned homes or lots for $1 per parcel to the people with the best plan for the seriously blighted property that had been acquired by the city through foreclosure.<br />
<br />
Salcedo and the other winners will each receive $100,000 in Restore NY funding, the state grant that helps residents turn eyesores into quality housing. Construction on the homes of each winner is expected to begin this month.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.baltimorehousing.org/slideshows/vtov.asp" target="_blank"><img alt="Eager Street after rehabbing" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/realestate.aol.com/blog/media/2013/07/1200eager1668a350x242.gif" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 4px; float: right;" /></a>Though she's past retirement age, Salcedo has been able to commit $46,000 in private financing to aid in reconstructing the single-family home as her primary residence. But to qualify, each entrant first had to put up at least $25,000 of his or her own funds and agree to complete the project within 12 months.<br />
<br />
"The One Dollar Healthy Home initiative is just another creative way to attract and drive private investment in our neighborhoods," said Mayor Matt Ryan in a press release.<br />
<br />
For one local woman contractor who entered and won, this is going to be her first home. Similarly, Craig Brigham III, who works for his family's general contracting firm, bought a $1 vacant lot to build a new, single-family residence for his primary residence. He has committed $48,725 in private financing for this new home construction.<br />
<br />
Philadelphia also offers homeowners with vacant lots adjacent to their properties the opportunity to purchase the <a href="http://philly.curbed.com/archives/2013/04/22/heres-how-to-buy-vacant-property-from-the-citys-redevelopment-authority-for-as-low-as-1.php">lots for $1</a> if the property is valued at less than $15,000 and is less than 3,000 square feet. However, transaction fees might bring the total purchase cost closer to $1,000.<br />

<a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/on/dollar-buys-indiana-abandoned-homes/">Indianapolis also just passed a buy-for-a-dollar housing program</a> to get occupants into vacant properties that did not sell at a tax sale. Applicants have to live adjacent to the abandoned property, qualify for an FHA renovation loan, and agree to make the property an extension of their home for at least three years. Plans still need to be put in place in order for the program to take effect.<br />

It's currently dangling $10,000 in down payments and closing costs to each of the first 50 buyers of Vacants to Value Houses. Its goal is to address 3,000 vacant residential buildings in the city by rehabilitating half of them in the next three years. (See the accompanying photos, as well as before-and-after photos in gallery below.)<br />
<br />
The Census Bureau says that there are about 15 million vacant housing units in the nation, an increase of 43.8 percent since 2000 when the number of vacant housing units totaled 10.4 million. Those 15 million units in 2010 represented 11.4 percent of the total housing units in the nation.<br />
<br />
The increase in the number of these programs might stem from a similar initiative at the federal level -- along with an infusion of federal funds. For instance, <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/reo/goodn/dhmabout">Dollar Homes</a> is a project by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that helps local governments foster housing opportunities for low-to-moderate-income families and address specific community needs by offering them the opportunity to purchase qualified HUD-owned homes for $1 each.<br />
<br />
Dollar Homes are single-family homes that are acquired by the Federal Housing Administration (which is part of HUD) as a result of foreclosure actions. Single-family properties are made available to cities through the program whenever the FHA is unable to sell the homes for six months.<br />
<br />
Local governments can partner with local nonprofit homeownership organizations or tap into existing local programs to resell the homes to low- and moderate-income residents of the community.<br />

The year-old program gives low-to-moderate income homebuyers up to $10,000 toward down payments and closing costs on purchases of vacant homes. The maximum annual household income must be $72,100 or less. Plans call for the program to expand to such towns as Champaign, in the central part of the state and home to the University of Illinois.<br />

<br />
Mardee Jerde is homeless today. At 9 a.m., a representative of JPMorgan Chase, along with a real estate agent and a locksmith, arrived to change the locks on her former three-bedroom house in Rush City, Minn. She's hoping that a last-ditch legal effort can get her home back, but meanwhile this breast-cancer survivor mourns the loss of the house, her blooming flowerbed, and the nearly $50,000 that she paid the bank in back payments and fees in exchange for what she believed was a chance to be approved for a permanent loan modification after a car accident left her unable to work.<br />
<br />
According to the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/south/213768981.html">Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>, two days after Chase cashed her check for $49,825 (which came from an insurance settlement resulting from the auto accident), Jerde received notice that the bank had denied her request to reduce her mortgage under the <a href="http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/programs/lower-payments/Pages/hamp.aspx">Home Affordable Modification Program</a>. It then proceeded with the foreclosure.<br />
<br />
"They had no legal right to do what they did," says the 70-year-old Jerde, who had lived in the home for 20 years on property that her mother had purchased in the 1970s. She bought the home from her father for $130,000 in 1995, after her mother passed away.<br />
<br />
"My barbecue grill, and scanner, and some other things are still in the shed, but everything else is out," she told AOL Real Estate. Many of her belongings are loaded in her car. She has no permanent place to go. There is a two-year wait for senior housing in a neighboring county, and no availability in her own county. Her children are grown with their own children or coping with their own illnesses. "They all have their lives and they don't need me," she says.<br />
<br />
For now Jerde is staying with a friend, Frank Winges, who recently retired early after a leg injury. Winges needs someone to help him out and is letting Jerde stay for a short while, she said. "He is my angel. His name even reminds me of angel wings, even though it's not pronounced like that," she says.<br />
<br />
Her encounter with JPMorgan Chase began about five years ago after it bought Washington Mutual, the bank that had given Jerde a forbearance and reduced her payments to $875.59, down from $1,763.10. Her original loan was with a local bank that Washington Mutual had bought. Once Chase denied the permanent modification, her payments were set to increase back to the original amount. That was about twice as much as she could afford, as she had used almost every penny of the insurance settlement to pay Chase the nearly $50,000.<br />
<br />
Chase sold her home to the government at a sheriff's auction in February 2011. She was given a chance to reclaim it for $209,908, if she could pay that amount in full by August of that year. She couldn't. Her notice of eviction was delivered June 17 of this year. The <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/index.html">government-sponsored mortgage lender known as Fannie Mae</a> then acquired the home by purchasing its debt for a mere $10. In countering her lawsuit to try to regain her home, Fannie Mae petitioned to move the <a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Quiet+Title+Action">quiet-title lawsuit</a> to federal court. Jerdes can only hope that her pro bono attorney can help put her back in her former home. But that case could be tied up for months -- or years. In the meantime, she said, she'll keeps looking for another place to live.<br />

<br />
Starting this week, hundreds of thousands of struggling borrowers could be in for a pleasant surprise: a quick and easy way to get their mortgage payments back on track -- and save considerable money.<br />
<br />
Through a new effort called the Streamlined Modification Initiative, borrowers with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who are at least 90 days behind on payments will start receiving offers from lenders to lower their mortgage payments.<br />
<br />
The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, won't say how many delinquent homeowners will receive the modifications, but the Mortgage Bankers Association reported in May that about 1.1 million borrowers are behind on their loans by three payments or more. Not all of those mortgage holders have Fannie or Freddie loans, however.<br />
<br />
The FHFA claims to have helped 2.7 million borrowers keep their homes through its other foreclosure prevention efforts, such as the Home Affordable Modification Program which was <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/04/news/economy/guidelines/index.htm?postversion=2009030512&amp;iid=EL">launched in March, 2009</a>.<br />
<br />
Unlike those previous efforts, however, the Streamlined Modification Initiative won't require borrowers to file any financial paperwork. Instead, they just need to make the new payments for a trial period of three months and then the modification becomes permanent.<br />
<br />
The FHFA said the extensive paperwork and procedures that other foreclosure prevention initiatives require has been a major obstacle in getting people the help they need. Paperwork gets lost, borrowers are asked to provide documents over and over again, and evaluating a borrower's eligibility can be time consuming.<br />
<br />
"This is a no-brainer and should have been done years ago," said David Berenbaum, who coordinates fair housing and fair lending compliance initiatives for the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit focused on fighting foreclosures.<br />
<br />
Lenders will lower a borrower's monthly payments by either extending the term of the loan -- usually from 30 to 40 years -- and reducing the interest rate. The new program falls short of reducing the principal on the loan, a move FHFA acting director <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/31/real_estate/fannie-freddie-principal-reduction/index.htm?iid=EL">Edward DeMarco has consistently blocked</a>.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the changes could mean big savings for anyone with a high-rate loan who was unable to refinance to the historically low rates of the past couple of years.<br />
<br />
Modifying a 30-year, $200,000 loan with a 5.5 percent rate to a 40-year term with a 4 percent rate will reduce the monthly payment to $835 from $1,135 -- a $300 difference.<br />
<br />
The loans must be at least 12 months old, borrowers can't be more than 24 months behind on payments and their principal balances must be 80 percent or more of the value of their homes. The new program is scheduled to last through December 2015.<br />

"Whether you're good with numbers predicts how likely you are to default," said Stephan Meier, an associate professor of business at Columbia Business School, who authored the report along with economists from the Federal Reserve of Atlanta and the University of Zurich.<br />
<br />
The study examined several hundred borrowers who held mortgages issued in 2006 and 2007 -- right before the mortgage meltdown. Of the study subjects, 25 percent of the borrowers who scored in the lowest bracket for math skills had defaulted on mortgage payments within five years of getting the loans. Meanwhile, only 5 percent of those in the top tier for math skills defaulted.<br />
<br />
The survey sample included homebuyers from a variety of backgrounds, from blue collar workers to corporate professionals. Their math ability covered the gamut -- from those with very limited abilities to a mathematician with a six-figure salary, according to Kristopher Gerardi, an economist with the Federal Reserve of Atlanta.<br />
<br />
The researchers controlled for differences in overall intelligence by measuring for verbal and general IQs, as well as math skills, and controlled for socioeconomic factors, such as age, sex, income, ethnicity and local labor market conditions.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, it did not seem to matter what kind of mortgage the borrowers had, the researchers found. "Those lacking [math skills] will still get in more trouble later on even if they pick a plain vanilla mortgage," said Meier.<br />
<br />
The researchers asked the survey participants a series of five basic questions. The simplest question asked them how much a $300 sofa would cost at a half-price sale. The most difficult asked how much a savings account of $200 would grow to after earning 10 percent interest for two years.<br />
<br />
Determining why those with poor math skills default on mortgages more often than others will take more research, but previous studies suggest that people who struggle with simple math also struggle with handling their finances, according to Gerardi. This group tends to budget less carefully, misuse credit cards and mishandle financial emergencies, such as temporary income losses. When they hit a rough financial patch, they may not understand the math well enough to negotiate the most favorable settlements with lenders.<br />
<br />
"When bad events happened, they don't react optimally," said Meier.<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON -- U.S. sales of previously occupied homes surpassed the 5 million mark in May, the first time that's happened in 3&amp;frac12; years. The gain shows the housing recovery is strengthening. The<a href="http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2013/06/existing-home-sales-rise-in-may-with-strong-price-increases"> National Association of Realtors</a> said Thursday that <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/home+sales/">home re-sales</a> rose 4.2 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.18 million. That's up from April's pace of 4.97 million.<br />
<br />
Sales last exceeded 5 million in November 2009. During that month and October 2009, a <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/homebuyer+tax+credit/">homebuying tax credit</a> briefly inflated the sales pace. Prior to that, sales hadn't been above 5 million since July 2007. While the sales pace is still below the 5.5 million that is consistent with healthy markets, it has risen nearly 13 percent in the past 12 months.<br />
<br />
And with a tight supply of homes on the market, the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/home+prices/">median sales price</a> rose to $208,000 -- the highest since July 2008. "Housing is now the strongest part of the economy in growth terms," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://realestate.search.aol.com/search?s_it=topsearchbox.search&amp;q=housing%20recovery">housing recovery</a> is looking more sustainable and should continue to boost economic growth this year, offsetting some of the drag from higher taxes and federal spending cuts. Steady hiring and low mortgage rates have encouraged more people to buy homes. And with demand up, prices rising and few homes on the market, builders have grown more optimistic about their prospects, leading to more construction and jobs.<br />
<br />
Sales of previously occupied homes rose last month in every region of the country. They increased 8 percent in the Midwest, 4 percent in the South, 2.5 percent in the West and 1.6 percent in the Northeast.The supply of homes for sales also grew, a sign that more homeowners are confident that they can lure buyers. The number of homes on the market rose 3.3 percent in May to 2.22 million. Still, inventories are 10 percent below year-ago levels.<br />
<br />
Still, the report showed that a critical part of the market remains weak. First-time buyers represented only 28 percent of buyers in May. That's down from 34 percent a year ago and significantly below more normal levels above 40 percent. The decline in first-time buyers suggests many younger Americas are unable to get financing.<br />
<br />
Banks have raised lending standards since the housing crisis, requiring higher credit scores, larger down payments and more detailed employment records. Distressed sales, which include foreclosures and short sales, accounted for 18 percent of May sales, unchanged from April. Both months matched the lowest share of distressed sales since the Realtors began tracking this data in October 2008. Distressed sales stood at 25 percent of sales in May 2012.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2013/06/20/mortgage-rates-drop/">Ben Bernanke cited the housing gains</a> as a major reason the Fed's economic outlook has brightened. Still, <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/mortgage+rates/">mortgage rates</a> have jumped in recent weeks. And they are expected to rise further now that the Fed has signaled it plans to scale back its bond purchases this year if the economy continues to strengthen. Higher mortgage rates could slow some of the housing market's momentum.<br />
<br />
A better outlook for housing has made builders more optimistic. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index rose in June to 52, up from 44 in May. It was the highest reading in more than seven years and the largest monthly increase in more than a decade. A reading above 50 indicates more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor.<br />
