<br />
Repainting a room is a quick way to <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2012/11/26/secrets-of-successful-house-flippers">freshen up your home</a>, but at $30 a gallon, premium paint is no picnic -- especially considering that a mid-sized bedroom could require two to three gallons.<br />
If you're ready for a new look, but don't have a lot of money to splurge, these seven tips will help you update your wall colors without spending a fortune.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Check your local recycling center. </strong>Recycling and hazardous waste centers usually take paint from local business owners who need to throw out old, unused paint. Since paint has a long shelf life, much of the paint that is thrown away in these centers is still good. And the best part is you can usually pick up this <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/09/23/5-strategies-for-scoring-freebies">paint for free</a>!<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Stop by the hardware store frequently. </strong>Hardware stores, paint specialty stores and even Walmarts usually have a mistints section where they sell discolored paint for a fraction of the cost. At Lowe's, for instance, you can pick up a $35 gallon of premium paint for under $15. You never know what you'll find, but it's worth swinging by this section of your local store.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Invest in better paint. </strong>When it comes to paint, you really do get what you pay for. Though you might not want to spring on the most expensive paint, the higher-end paints cover better, which means you use less paint, and they're less messy (so no accidental drips on the floor that <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2013/06/25/how-to-decorate-an-apartment-without-forfeiting-your-security-deposit">could cost to clean up</a>later). They also tend to be more durable, making your new paint job last longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Use primer. </strong>There are times when you don't have to use primer, but if you're painting raw wood, raw drywall, stained surfaces or rough surfaces, you'll definitely need to use primer. Also, if you're painting a dark color or dramatically changing the color of your walls, primer will help your paint cover better, so you use less. Typically, one coat of primer and one coat of paint will be cheaper than two or three coats of paint.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Learn to paint like a professional.</strong> Inexperienced painters tend to try to squeeze all the paint out of a roller every time. It seems like this would make sense, since you use all the paint you put on the roller. But rolling on thicker layers with a lighter touch actually uses less paint and looks more professional.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Buy in bulk.</strong> Buying paint in five-gallon cans is cheaper than buying it in one-gallon cans. Typically, a 5 gallon bucket of paint will cost about the same as four one-gallon buckets -- so you get a whole gallon for free. If you're painting a lot of square footage, choosing a single color to use on most of the walls can <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/slideshows/8-painless-ways-to-save-money">save you a lot of money</a>. You could also talk to your local paint store about buying several one-gallon buckets of paint at a bulk price.<br />
<br />
<strong>7. Cover your rollers and brushes.</strong> Sometimes it takes a few days to complete a larger painting project. If you have to quit before you're done with a paint color, don't rinse out those brushes and rollers. That's just a waste of time and paint! Instead, wrap them tightly in plastic bags, tied with a rubber band or some twine. When you're ready to resume painting the next day, just unwrap your rollers, and go.<br />
<br />
But the easiest way to save on paint? Buy less. If you're really on a tight budget, consider simply <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2012/10/03/1003mymoney2">redecorating your home</a> with an accent wall instead of painting the entire room. Another excellent way to upgrade the look of a room -- especially if you still like the overall color scheme -- is to paint the ceiling a lighter version of the wall color, instead of just a boring ceiling white.<br />

<strong>By <a href="http://www.zillowblog.com/author/brendondesimone/" target="_blank">Brendon DeSimone</a></strong><br />
<br />
Whether you just bought a condo or have owned one for years, you've probably accepted the monthly <a href="http://www.zillowblog.com/2012-07-25/what-to-review-in-hoa-documents-when-buying/">homeowners association dues</a> at face value. But there are reasons why you shouldn't. <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/HOAs/">HOA</a> dues are money out of your pocket.<br />
<br />
They can have a huge impact on <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2010/11/16/hoas-what-homebuyers-need-to-know/">your decision to buy</a>, or not buy, a particular home. For example, you might have fallen in love with a condo in a big complex but decided you just can't afford the HOA dues. Also, high HOA dues can be a deterrent to future buyers, too, when you go to sell later.<br />
<br />
An HOA is made up of residents of the condo building or complex -- volunteers who are busy with their jobs and families just like everyone else. It could be that no one on the HOA board has time to look for ways to reduce the monthly HOA dues. But like any budget, there could be lots of ways to reduce expenses. Here's how you can have a positive impact on your HOA dues:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Ask to see the HOA budget. </strong>As a condo owner, you have the right to review the HOA budget. Get a copy and check it over thoroughly. If you have questions, ask the HOA president or a board member.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Join the HOA board. </strong>If you're on the board, you'll have more opportunity and more clout to dig into the HOA's finances -- such as its contracts with the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/directory/property-management/" target="_blank">property management</a> company, landscapers and so on.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Review the HOA's contracts. </strong>An HOA often has agreements with a variety of vendors: the property management company, a landscaping/grounds maintenance company, and so on. In some cases, those agreements or contracts may have been negotiated years ago and might be renegotiated today in more favorable terms for the HOA.<br />
<br />
For example, the recent buyer of a <a href="http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Atlanta-GA/apartment_condo_type/37211_rid/33.988634,-84.109612,33.546259,-84.731712_rect/10_zm/0_mmm/" target="_blank">condo in an Atlanta</a> complex felt like the HOA dues were too high. So he asked to join the board, and the members were happy to have him. He then performed an audit and discovered money was being wasted in several areas, such as on landscaping/gardening.<br />
<br />
The HOA's agreement with its gardener had been negotiated five years earlier. The gardener, by default, raised his fees every year. The Atlanta condo buyer, with the HOA's approval, sought bids from a variety of other gardening companies and succeeded in finding a reputable gardener at a lower monthly cost.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Reduce landscaping costs. </strong>If finding another landscaping or gardening company isn't an option, maybe the HOA can reduce the frequency of these services, without jeopardizing aesthetics. It's worth asking.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Determine if the HOA is paying too much in property management fees. </strong>In large condo developments, the property management company would likely be the one to lead the charge to reduce expenses. But they're unlikely to advocate lowering their own fees. So you'll need to work with your HOA directly in exploring ways to reduce the property management company's fees.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Look at insurance premiums. </strong>Insurance is often a big HOA expense. Get quotes for insurance premiums and be prepared to renegotiate with your current carrier once your policy comes up for renewal.<br />
<br />
<strong>7. Defer non-essential maintenance or other projects. </strong>Aside from HOA dues, condo owners are often hit with assessments to cover things such as roof repairs and hallway painting. Talk to the HOA board about deferring any non-essential HOA projects for a year or two.<br />
<br />
<strong>8. Reduce reserves, if possible. </strong>Every HOA has reserve funds to cover unexpected expenses. Over time, those reserves, if not tapped, build up. Find out how much the HOA has in reserves. If it's a healthy amount and no major improvement or repair projects are in the works, ask the HOA board to consider temporarily reducing the amount it puts into reserves every month.<br />
<br />
Easier said than done?<br />
<br />
Most HOAs will welcome your participation. But your belt-tightening suggestions may require a formal vote from HOA board members or the entire association before they're enacted. At any rate, understand that changes to the budget may not happen overnight. Finding the fat, renegotiating fees, and asking for additional bids can be extremely time consuming.<br />
<br />
Still, it's worth a try. Talk to your HOA president, treasurer or other board member. Tell them your goal is to simply explore possible ways to lower the association's cost for everyone's benefit. A little bit of legwork may save you -- and your neighbors -- some money every month.<br />

Creating your first budget can be daunting, but it's extremely important when you're moving out on your own for the first time. If you bite off more than you can chew, you may not have enough money to buy yourself something to chew on. Here are step-by-step instructions to help you create your first budget:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Determine your net income.</strong> The first step is <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2010/09/20/are-you-paying-too-much-for-your-rental/">figuring out your net income</a>, which is not the same as your salary. Your gross income is what you earn; your net income is what you end up with after taxes, health insurance, Social Security, 401(k) deductions and anything else that comes out of your check. This is the amount of money you'll have to work with when you're budgeting.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Make a list of monthly payments and expenses.</strong> Now the real work starts. Make a list of all of the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2013/09/13/best-ways-shop-rental-home/">fixed payments</a> you absolutely have to make each month, including gas, electricity, <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2013/05/15/when-you-need-renters-insurance/">renters insurance</a>, loans, credit cards, car payments and car insurance. These costs are less flexible than others, so you'll want to form your budget around them.<br />
<br />
Next, write down all of your anticipated expenses. These include basics that you spend money on each month such as cable, Internet, food, household items, pet supplies, gym membership, prescriptions, clothing, hobbies and activities. This is where your online bank account can be an excellent resource. Scroll through your spending over the past few months to ensure you have all of your bases covered with a comprehensive spending list. When you're figuring out a budget, it's important to be honest and realistic. Otherwise, your budget loses its purpose. Sure, you keep telling yourself not to spend $100 every month on your wardrobe, but if that's what you're spending, it needs to be in your budget.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Establish your rent budget.</strong> After you've budgeted for fixed costs and the basics, it's time to determine what you can afford for rent. A general rule experts recommend is to spend no more than one-third of your net income on rent per year. However, like every general rule, there are many exceptions. If you don't think you can afford to spend a third of your net income on rent, don't do it. Figuring out after the fact that you can't afford your monthly rent is going to cause a lot of stress for you, your roommates and your landlord. When it comes to making monetary promises, it's always better to be safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Save for emergencies and retirement.</strong> It sounds like a pain, but it's important to put a portion of every paycheck into your savings account-preferably 10 percent of your net income. Even if things are tight and you can only put a small amount away each month, it's worth it. You will thank yourself in the future when your car breaks down, you need a root canal or you get laid off. Plus, retirement may seem far off now, but your 20s are the perfect time to begin saving because you will accumulate interest over your lifetime.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Make tweaks and stick to it.</strong> This is the most important step in the budgeting process: You must stick to it! Budgeting isn't a one-time thing; it's a life-long process. Review your budget regularly to make sure you're staying on track and make any necessary tweaks.<br />
<br />
<strong>Congrats:</strong> You are now ready to tackle world on a budget. If you want to move beyond the pen and paper approach, there are lots of websites that can help figure out a budget and track your spending habits.<br />

To successfully purchase a home today, you will need a <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/down+payment/">down payment</a> of at least 3.5 percent of the purchase price. Gone are the days of <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/01/4-ways-to-get-a-mortgage-for-little-or-no-money-down/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_1&amp;utm_campaign=creative_down_payment">no down payment alternatives</a>, down payment assistance and seller-offered programs to come up with the money needed to <a href="http://www.sonomacountymortgages.com/2012/08/buy-a-house/">buy a home</a>. Instead, let's look at the five ways you can come up with a down payment to seal the deal.<br />
<br />
<b>1. Gift Money:</b> Gift money is simply that -- a gift from family or documented close relationship. The giftor needs to provide a <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/03/the-biggest-mortgage-mistake/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;utm_campaign=creative_down_payment" title="The Biggest Mortgage Mistake Consumers Make">gift letter and paper trail</a> for the monies they are gifting for the benefit of the buyer. In other words, they'll have to provide a bank account showing that they had the ability to gift the money. In short, gift monies cannot be funds sitting at home in a safe.<br />
<br />
<b>2. 401(k)/Retirement Loan:</b> Typically, borrowed funds for a down payment are a no-go, but the exception is a 401(k) or equivalent retirement account (or current home equity line). If you can borrow money from your 401(k) for your down payment, this is accepted for obtaining a purchase mortgage loan. Note: Depending on the terms of your loan, this could be counted as a liability and <i>factored into your debt-to-income ratio.</i><br />
<br />
<b>3. Sale of a Good:</b> Believe it or not, you can sell your recreational vehicle and use the net proceeds from the transaction as your down payment. Let's say that you decide to sell your motorcycle for $10,000. You'll need to provide the full bill of sale -- as well as the bank statement depositing those funds, matching the bill of sale -- to your mortgage lender. Same goes for any other recreational vehicle, or other item that "makes sense." The key is as long as it's plausible and passes the litmus test and you can paper trail the monies from start to finish, you should have no problem using those monies for the <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/08/wait-to-get-a-mortgage/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_4&amp;utm_campaign=creative_down_payment" title="5 Times It Pays to Wait to Get a Mortgage">house purchase</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>4. Trust Funds, Settlement Awards, etc.:</b> If you come into a chunk of change via an inheritance, settlement, lottery winning, trust fund disbursement, family buyout, even a gambling victory, all of these monies can be used for the down payment as long as the sourcing of the monies is fully documented from A to Z with no stone left unturned. Matching of the amounts of monies used to the original deposits will be required when it comes time to secure the loan.<br />
<br />
<b>5. Line of Credit:</b> Where a down payment lacks, enter strength in income. You can take out a line of credit or a <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/05/personal-loan-beats-credit-card/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_5&amp;utm_campaign=creative_down_payment" title="3 Times When a Personal Loan Beats a Credit Card">personal loan</a>, deposit the full funds into your bank account and after two months, the funds will be eligible for use in the transaction.<br />
<br />
While a down payment is needed to purchase in the current real estate market, a prudent homebuyer should also have plans for having available funds for <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/02/19-confusing-mortgage-terms-deciphered/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_6&amp;utm_campaign=creative_down_payment" title="19 Confusing Mortgage Terms Deciphered">closing costs</a>. The same out-of-the-box strategies listed above can also be used to procure funds for closing costs.<br />
<br />
Closing costs run at about 3 percent of the purchase price, on average. So the total funds to close would be 3 percent of purchase price plus 3.5 percent down.<br />
<br />
Do your homework. If you don't have a down payment for a house, or your down payment is coming from more than one source, make sure that you talk to a lender upfront so they can help you navigate the best way to properly support and document your monies used. Doing this on the front end will save you from wasting time creating and gathering unnecessary paperwork.<br />

Making the move from renter to homeowner is challenging for nearly everyone, and the highest hurdle for most first-time buyers is saving enough money for a down payment. If your No. 1 priority in the next few years is to become a homeowner, financial experts say you'll likely need to make some aggressive moves to cut your spending, boost your income, or both.<br />
<br />
The National Association of Realtors reported that the national median home price in June 2013 was $199,900 (<a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2013/09/03/home-prices-climbed-july/" target="_blank">and prices are rising again</a>). For the purposes of this article, we assume that your goal is to buy a house in two years with a 10 percent down payment of $20,000.<br />
<br />
To get started, set a timeline and break up your savings goals, suggests Anna Behnam, an Ameriprise financial advisor in Rockville, Md. To save $20,000 in two years, you'll need to save $833 a month for the next 24 months.<br />
<br />
"Create an account that will hold only savings designated for your new home," Behnam suggests. "This can help keep you organized and track your progress."<br />
<br />
<strong>Start Big</strong><br />
<br />
If you're truly committed to buying a home and can handle some big changes in lifestyle, you could move in with family for a defined period of time. You could also move to a smaller apartment.<br />
<br />
"Going from a two-bedroom to a one-bedroom can drop your rent by 25 to 30 percent, depending on where you live," says Rob Jupille, president of RTJ Financial Management in Los Angeles. "If you have a spare room, take in a renter until you save what you need."<br />
<br />
Another possible lifestyle change is to bring in more income by working overtime if possible or taking on another job.<br />
<br />

Timothy Murray, a certified financial planner and owner of Murray Financial in Chantilly, Va., suggests looking for a job doing something that interests you outside of your current career, such as working at a Lowe's or Home Depot if you're a home improvement enthusiast or want to learn more about how to take care of the home you plan to buy.<br />
<br />
"If your savings goal is aggressive, you may decide that you're willing to make large trade-offs to meet your goal," says Behnam.<br />
<br />
For a significant boost to your down-payment fund, consider more substantial cost-cutting and money-raising measures, such as selling your current car and trading down to a lower-cost vehicle.<br />
<br />
<strong>Small Steps That Add Up to Big Savings</strong><br />
<br />
Finding other expenditures to trim requires <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2013/07/31/three-simple-steps-making-ends-meet/" target="_blank">creating a household budget </a>to see where your money is going.<br />
<br />
Some of the easier expenses to reduce or eliminate include new clothes, shoes, and other stuff; daily expenses like your morning specialty coffee; monthly expenses like a Netflix subscription; and gas and parking costs (consider carpooling or take public transportation), Behnam says.<br />
<br />
"Keep in mind when you're in super-saver mode to ask yourself out loud, 'Do I need this or want it?' before you buy anything," says Behnam. "Shop in physical stores if possible (rather than online) and use physical cash rather than credit."<br />
<br />
Take a critical look at all of your expenditures -- gym memberships, vacations, entertainment -- to see where you can cut back to meet your savings goal. While you don't want to drain all the enjoyment out of your life, you can keep spending in check without sacrificing much. For example, if you like to go to restaurants with friends, Murray says, limit your meals out to one a week, and invite friends over for potlucks instead.<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2013/08/01/three-simple-steps-how-to-start-saving-for-retirement/" target="_blank">Retirement Savings</a> vs. Funding a Down Payment</strong><br />
<br />
If you're contributing more to your 401(k) than the company will match, temporarily scale back your contribution to the company match for a couple of years and put that extra cash in your down payment fund, suggests Jupille.<br />
<br />
Scott Cramer, a financial planner and president of Cramer &amp; Rauchegger in Maitland, Fla., says you might want to consider boosting your IRA contributions so you can use the funds for your down payment.<br />
<br />
"The first-home exemption rule allows individuals to use up to $10,000 in IRA funds toward the purchase of a first home without incurring the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty that applies to withdrawals made from a traditional IRA before age 59&amp;frac12;," says Cramer. "If you're married, you and your spouse can each pull from your retirement accounts, giving you $20,000."<br />
<br />
Before you do this, though, be aware that even though the penalty is waived, you have to pay income taxes on the withdrawal. A Roth IRA withdrawal is considered a "qualified distribution" if you've had the account for at least five years, and Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free, Cramer says.<br />
<br />
<strong>Where to Stash Your Cash</strong><br />
<br />
When you're saving for a short-term goal, financial experts recommend you stick with a low-risk investment such as a high-yield savings account or a CD. A credit union or an online bank usually offers better interest rates on savings than most traditional banks.<br />
<br />
While it is tempting to invest your down-payment savings for a higher return, be aware that there's always a risk that an investment will lose money. Murray says that the rate of return on your down payment savings is less important than making sure the money is available when you need it.<br />
<br />
Whether your goal is to buy a house or meet some other financial obligation, you'll need discipline and an aggressive savings plan to achieve it. But following the savings tips above will help put your goal within reach.<br />

<br />
Vacation is a time to escape for a little rest and relaxation, but it's also the time thieves increasingly break into empty homes. According to recent claims data from insurance company Travelers, theft increases during the summer months largely because more people are away. But it's not only criminals you have to worry about while you are kicking back, you also have to be concerned about potential damage from a broken pipe, busted hot water heater or other unexpected mishaps.<br />
<br />
"Things happen while you are away," says Jim Gustin, senior property specialist Travelers. "There are multiple perils homeowners need to worry and think about." Nobody wants to come home from a vacation to find their home has been burgled or discover their furniture floating about because of a flood. To reduce the chances of that happening follow these four tips from insurance experts, after all doing nothing can be costly: According to a Nationwide survey, the average cost to replace stolen belongings is close to $3,600.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 1: Make it look like someone's home.</strong> Burglars prey on easy targets and will go after homes that look like empty; nothing screams unoccupied more than mail and newspapers piling up in front of the door front and a dark house at nighttime. Melissa Digby, director, loss prevention and safety at insurance provider USAA, recommends leaving the TV or a radio on to create noise.<br />
<br />
Have a friend or neighbor collect mail and newspapers or place a temporary stop on both until you return. Set timers to turn on interior and exterior lights and other electronic devices at random times to give the appearance that someone is home, says Nationwide spokesman Jarrett Dunbar. Digby also advises alerting the local law enforcement that you will be away and ask a trusted neighbor to keep an eye out for strange activity.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 2: Keep your vacation private.</strong> Thanks to Facebook and Twitter, we've become a nation of over-sharers. We share our moods, meals and pictures and while most of the time all that information is harmless, posting when you leave and come back is an open invitation to robbers. "People like to tell everyone where they are going on Facebook but the problem is they are telling everybody they are leaving," says Gustin.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 3: Consider a water detection alarm.</strong> Flooding can cause a lot of damage in a short amount of time, so you can easily imagine what would happen if you were away for a week and had no idea a pipe burst. Digby of USAA says a water detection alarm can help detect a problem early. "These devices alert you when a possible water leak is detected so that you can take action. In addition to an audible alarm, many can also be programmed to shut off the water to the appliance or main water supply to your home when a leak is detected."<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 4: Prepare for severe weather. </strong>You pack your vacation attire to deal with inclement weather, so prep your home before jetting off. If your vacation is during the summer and you live in an area prone to hurricanes, Gustin says to secure any outdoor furniture, close and lock all shutters and unplug any appliances that may be susceptible to a power surge if there is a lighting storm.<br />
<br />
Winter travelers face the risk of a frozen pipe that explodes. To prevent that from happening, Digby suggest keeping a slow trickle of water flowing through the outside faucets, fit exposed pipes with a minimum of two inches of insulation and keep the thermostat no lower than 55 degrees. "When taking an extended vacation, consider shutting off the main water supply and draining the water system to keep water from freezing inside the pipes and bursting them," she says.

<br />
Today, there is still a general consensus that to buy a home you need to have 20 percent down and a good-to-excellent credit history. The good news is you actually don't need a large down payment or <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/06/hel-my-credit-score/" target="_blank">great credit</a> in order to purchase a home with competitive market terms. Let's look at the characteristics of what a mortgage lender deems to be bad credit when it comes time to qualify for a mortgage loan.<br />
<br />
<strong>Credit Score Scale </strong><br />
<br />
740-800 Outstanding<br />
720-740 Great<br />
700-720 Good<br />
680-700 Mediocre<br />
*620-680 Less than perfect, but approvable<br />
<br />
A mortgage company's definition of bad credit might not be what a consumer considers to be bad credit. A credit score of 620 or higher is required to successfully obtain a mortgage. By the same token, a 620 credit score is considered by a lender to be less than perfect, but it's still possible to get a mortgage with that score.<br />
<br />
Your credit score determines two major things for a mortgage company:<br />
<strong>Loan program</strong> - Whether it's a conventional or FHA-type mortgage.<br />
<strong>Pricing</strong> - This includes your interest rate and any additional charges indicative of the credit score (the lower the credit score, the higher the interest rate and/or potential charges).<br />
<br />
Your credit history is the next factor in determining whether or not your loan will be approved. Is there a pattern of <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/03/9-mistakes-that-kill-your-credit/" target="_blank">previous credit delinquencies</a>? Are there balances on closed-out accounts? It's common for a consumer to have a 620 credit score, and have a consistent historical pattern of derogatory credit. Interestingly, this person would have a more difficult time obtaining mortgage loan approval than someone with a 640 credit score with no history of delinquencies other than a foreclosure from a couple of years before.<br />
<br />
In order of priority, lenders will look at the credit score to determine which home loan you're eligible for. Next, the complete credit overview will be taken into consideration to determine what questions may or may not arise in the underwriting decision process. The underwriting process will be looking for "what happened," "why it happened" and the future "likelihood of continuance or repeat non-repayment."<br />
<br />
<strong>Common Credit Red Flags for Lenders</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Pattern of Delinquencies </strong>- A record of late payments is possible to work around, but more lender scrutiny will be given to the size of your down payment and your debt-to-income percentage.<br />
<strong>Student Loan Late Payments</strong> - If you had a late payment on your student loans within the past 12 months, you may be more likely to be approved for conventional financing.<br />
<strong>Government financing</strong> - like FHA - does not take kindly to delinquent federal debt.<br />
<strong>Mortgage Late Payments</strong> -- One late payment in the past 12 months is permitted, so long as it can be explained and, if necessary, fully documented.<br />
<strong>Foreclosure</strong> - 36 months from the date of the foreclosure you'll become eligible for a 3.5% down FHA loan; for a <a href="http://www.sonomacountymortgages.com/va-loans/" target="_blank">VA loan</a>, 48 months and no money down required; conventional loans require seven years no matter the down payment.<br />
<strong>Short sale</strong> - It takes 36 months from the date of the short sale until you're eligible using a 3.5% down payment FHA loan; 24 months with the VA loan; 24 months on a conventional loan with a minimum down payment of 20%.<br />
<strong>Bankruptcy</strong> - With Chapter 7 (Chapter 13 is less common), you have 24 months from the date of discharge until you're eligible using a 3.5% down FHA loan; 48 months on VA loans (still no money down required); and 48 months on conventional loans, no matter the down payment.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why You Can Get a Mortgage With Bad Credit</strong><br />
<br />
There's a thing called investor overlays, which are adjustments to guidelines and/or pricing created in favor of the lender. This is precisely why one lender can do a loan for someone with bad credit and minimal (or no) down payment, and another lender cannot do the loan in some instances.<br />
<br />
Overlays further protect lenders against potential future losses from the home loans they originate, preserving profit margins and buyback risk (an event in which the originating lender is forced to buy back from the investor if the loan they made was not fully documented). Investor overlays tighten the screws on borrowers' ability to borrow. Put another way, it shifts risk -- which translates to cost -- on to the consumer by means of limiting the ability to borrow via higher loan fees, reduced purchase price, or lower debt ratio, to name a few.<br />
<br />
Note: Every mortgage lender has investor overlays, it's the nature of how mortgage companies operate, the key is to work with a lender whose overlays are minimal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Homebuyer Homework</strong><br />
<br />
Know your credit score, first and foremost (you can monitor your score for free using a service like <a href="https://www.credit.com/free-credit-score/" target="_blank">Credit.com's Credit Report Card</a>). Obtain a copy of your credit report (which you can do for free through <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>), this will aid you in selecting the appropriate lender. Get as much supporting documentation as possible surrounding your credit challenges so the story can be explained from A to Z.<br />
<br />
When speaking with a potential lender, be very specific. Do not be afraid to share every detail of your needs and concerns, giving the most complete description possible. Find out upfront if they have any additional conditions with regard to credit history, as doing so could save you considerable time and money.<br />

<br />
A Minnesota couple who signed rental agreements on Twin Cities-area homes reportedly managed to live rent-free for months after moving in and allegedly refusing to pay rent. By the time their eviction made it through the court process, though, their landlords were out thousands of dollars, says a local TV station.<br />
<br />
When the bubble burst on the housing market about five years ago an explosion of first-time "accidental landlords" were created -- when owners decided to rent out homes that they couldn't sell or chose not to sell at decreased value. Lower housing prices, meanwhile, led others to buy homes at bargain prices and turn them into rentals. Some of these inexperienced landlords fell prey to the kind of renters who cost much more than they pay in rent -- if they pay at all. Purported examples of these are Daniel and Rachel Helms who, their recent landlords say, didn't even have money in the bank to cover their $1,700 security deposit check.<br />
<br />
"I deposited it, and the next day I had noticed in my Wells Fargo account that it had bounced," accidental landlord Cody Johnson told Minneapolis TV station<a href="http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2013/07/22/thinking-of-renting-out-your-house-avoid-these-people/"> WCCO</a> (as seen in the video below). After moving to a larger home and putting their former one up for rent, Johnson and his wife Amy Macht thought that they had found the ideal tenants, they said.<br />
<br />
"These people seemed very polite, very nice," Macht said. But the Helms were not who they said they were. Their names were misspelled by them on their rental application and as a result, when the landlords ran a background check on them, they didn't discover that this wasn't the first time the renters had allegedly cheated the system.<br />
<br />
They found charges of the Helms fraudulently receiving public assistance and not paying bills, including failure to pay three other landlords, WCCO reported. In addition, the station said, they have suspended drivers licenses -- though that didn't stop them from having a U-Haul trailer hooked up to a vehicle in their driveway as they informed a WCCO reporter that they would be moving out soon with their four children.<br />
<br />
Johnson said of Daniel Helms: "He told us he's always wanted to pay but he hasn't been able to find work as a painter to cover his bills, and that he's the victim of people writing him bad checks." That's not too different from what the Helms purportedly told Melissa and Mark Damon, other landlords who said that they had trusted the couple but did not receive the rent due them. After weeks of texting various excuses, the Damons' told the Helms family to move out.<br />
<br />
"We get a text back, 'Sorry you're going to have to take us to court. We have nowhere to go. The judge will have to tell us when we can move,' " Melissa Damon said.<br />
<br />
The court order to move out took four months. They owed the Damons $6,400 on rent and the court ordered that they pay $10,000 in damages. But the renters left them holding the bag, the Damons said -- along with 66 bags filled with garbage that were found in the rental's garage. In addition, reported WCCO, there were holes in the property's walls, as well as carpet stains and water damage.<br />
<br />
Here are some ways that landlords can avoid falling victim to deadbeat tenants -- though nothing is foolproof.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Check applicants' credit scores. </strong>If a prospective tenant has had a car repossessed, a foreclosure, or is in significant credit card debt, the homeowner should be careful about renting to that tenant. Bad credit should raise concern about the ability to pay rent and pay on time.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Do criminal background checks.</strong> Although Johnson and Macht took this step, it was on a 0 name. So also ask for photo ID and other proof to make sure that prospective renters are who they say they are.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Check with the motor vehicles department.</strong> In several states that allow online payments for license tab renewals, the DMV will also have drivers' information available online. Have potential tenants log into the site and show you verification of their drivers license information against the forms of ID they present.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Take a cashier's check for the security deposit.</strong> For the security deposit or first month's rent, require that they pay with a cashier's check. Or if they will pay by personal check, make sure that the check clears at least a week before the move-in date. Though please note: Scammers have been known to <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2010/06/08/real-estate-scam-artist-from-evicted-to-convicted/">write phony cashier's checks</a>, as AOL Real Estate has reported.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Call their employers. </strong>You only want to rent to those gainfully employed, so actually pick up the phone and call employers to see how long prospective renters have been employed by them. If an employer is fairly local, perhaps even make an in-person visit, as it's not unusual for someone looking to scam to also arrange to have someone other than an employer talk to you on the phone. That was the case with <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2010/06/08/real-estate-scam-artist-from-evicted-to-convicted/">serial evicted tenant Pamela Winegardner</a> who maintained several phone numbers and answered them in different voices, just to give herself rave recommendations.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Use the Internet to verify facts.</strong> There is so much in the public domain. You can search for names on phone directory websites or places like <a href="http://www.Intelius.com">Intelius.com</a> that will give you approximate ages and cities where people have lived. Former employers' websites may also be listed (although Winegardner also created websites for fake businesses of her purported past employers). See how the information compares to what they are telling you and what else the background check reveals.<br />

<br />
Anyone who has tried to apply for a mortgage and had student loans knows what it's like to be scrutinized and questioned by the mortgage company over the impact of those obligations. Like other forms of debt, such as car loans or credit cards, student loans are in the same classification: debt made against income or rather an <i>ability to repay</i>.<br />
<br />
Just like all consumer debts, student loans can <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/05/how-student-loans-can-keep-you-from-buying-a-home/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB&amp;utm_campaign=student_loans_hurt_mortgage_app" title="How Student Loans Can Keep You From Buying a Home">reduce the ability to borrow</a> because they erode income. So let's take a closer look at how your student loans can hurt your mortgage application, and what you can do to protect yourself.<br />
<br />
<b>Quick Life-Cycle -- Student Loan To Home Loan: </b>Student loans are reported on a credit report just as any other payment obligation. In many instances, the <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/06/pay-student-loans-cant-afford/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB&amp;utm_campaign=student_loans_hurt_mortgage_app" title="How to Pay Student Loans You Can't Afford">student loan payments are deferred</a><b>,</b> extended out into a future date when the payments kick-in -- if they have not already. Lenders are required by law to account for all material debt known to them in the supporting documentation that a borrower provides in anticipation of acquiring a home loan.<br />
<br />
Student loans are the wildcard because they can show a payment at $50 per month on an obligation all the way up through $100 per month and higher. It's not so much the monthly payment per student loan that lenders have to overcome, but in most cases it's multiple student loans with multiple lenders, each showing a payment anywhere between $50-$80 per month.<br />
<br />
For example, a consumer's <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/04/how-do-student-loans-impact-your-credit/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB&amp;utm_campaign=student_loans_hurt_mortgage_app" title="How Do Student Loans Impact Your Credit?">credit report</a> might show six separate student loans totaling $50,000, each with a payment of $80 per month. That translates to a $480 per month obligation, which can reduce borrowing power by upwards of $60,000! Let's look at the path for a student loan borrower who's trying to buy a house:<br />
<br />
1. Consumer decides to take out various large student loans in excess of $50,000 (average amount) to pay for college tuition.<br />
2. Finishes college in hope of landing an occupation, with the expectation of earning an income large enough to afford <i>student loan payments and a housing payment.</i><br />
3. Enter -- decision to buy a house.<br />
4. Consumer takes the next step -- speaks with a mortgage lender about purchasing a house.<br />
5. Student loan(s) resurface into financial picture negatively affecting purchasing power.<br />
6. Consumer's expectation of purchase price becomes "subject to change" based upon all liability payments.<br />
7. Consumer <a href="http://www.sonomacountymortgages.com/purchase-mortgage-loans/">purchases a house</a> with student loan payments counted for and makes timely repayments of principal and interest on both mortgage and student loans.<br />
<br />
<b>How To Keep Your Mortgage Application From Being Denied:</b> If a student hopes to someday buy a home, he or she would be well advised to avoid private lenders when obtaining a student loan. Private lenders charge significantly higher rates of interest and can contain shorter-term amortizations inflating the payment obligation, which is what the mortgage lender will use when trying to qualify you for a home loan.<br />
<br />
<b>Further tips:</b><br />
o. If you have multiple student loans, consolidate them into one loan to reduce total student loan payments (speak to a lender first).<br />
o. If student loans are consolidated and they don't report that way on the credit report, the lender has to use the information they have showing the higher payments because that's what the credit report reveals, unless further supporting documentation can be provided to show each loan has been consolidated into one new debt.<br />
o. Avoid any <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/06/neverending-student-loan-nightmare/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB&amp;utm_campaign=student_loans_hurt_mortgage_app" title="How to Stop a Neverending Student Loan Nightmare">student loan delinquencies</a>, especially in the last 12 months. Ignoring this could result in your application being denied for a government loan. Government programs are strict about delinquencies on federal debt, which is what a student loan is.<br />
o. If student loans report as <i>deferred</i> on your credit report, get the specific payment amounts from the servicer or a payment letter from the servicer stating an approximation of what the payments will be when they come due and payable.<br />
o. If a payment letter cannot be obtained, the lender will use 2 percent of the principle balance to determine appropriate payment obligation for qualifying.<br />
o. If any student loans are paid off in full, but your credit report shows that there is a current payment obligation, provide supporting documentation to the mortgage company showing that it has been paid off in full.<br />
<br />
*<a href="http://www.sonomacountymortgages.com/mortgage-loans-credit-scores/">Credit</a> Caveat -- if a student loan is in deferment for 12 months or longer, only on an FHA Loan can the payment be omitted from the lender's qualifying ratios. Qualifying ratios are used by the lender to determine your ability to borrow.<br />
<br />
<b>Qualifying for a Mortgage Out of College:</b> If you are a former student, and have a limited work history and student loan debt, you can still potentially qualify for a home loan if your field of study was in direct relationship to your field of of employment. For example, you have a degree in accounting and you've recently taken a job as an accountant. Furthermore, if you were previously a full-time student, and you were not required to file a federal income tax return, you can still qualify for financing as you were not required to file IRS tax returns.<br />

<br />
The collapse of an <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/abandoned+homes/">abandoned house</a> next door onto her home has left a <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/home-values-listings/New-Orleans_LA">New Orleans</a> mother concerned about the safety of her children and damage to her property. But after being notified of the situation two weeks ago, complained the woman, city officials still hadn't acted to clean up the mess or reduce the threat.<br />
<br />
"Kids can't play with this right here, because they'll still get hurt with the nails and all that stuff hanging out," Keyana Maxwell told New Orleans <a href="http://www.wwltv.com/news/consumer/Action-Report-Abandoned-House-Collapses-In-Neighbors-Yard-216466631.html">TV station WWL</a>, which investigated her claims about the wreckage next door. Maxwell said that she'd contacted city officials, urging them to remove the collapsed home so that her kids can play in their backyard of their townhouse, and sleep in their bedrooms again without fear of debris crashing in.<br />
<br />
As WWL was interviewing Maxwell, however, a utility crew arrived to mark locations where electrical lines exist on the adjacent property -- so that a demolition crew could avoid them when tearing down what remains of the home.<br />
<br />
While Maxwell told the station that she expected a more rapid response, in many cases city officials have to first assess a situation to determine the best cause of action. And even though it might not be apparent, action might be taking place -- in terms of moving paperwork at least.<br />
<br />
In <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/home-values-listings/Asheville_NC">Asheville, N.C.</a>, neighbors were likewise concerned about an abandoned and sinking home that slid down a hill this month after a landslide, threatening their homes. They didn't think government officials there weren't moving fast enough, <a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20130712/NEWS01/307120026/Collapsing-home-Asheville-concerns-neighbors">reported the Citizen-Times</a> newspaper. But county emergency officials and engineers told residents they did not want to trigger movement that might upset the soil and cause the home to slide. As a result during this evaluation period there was not even removal of a tree that had fallen, blocking road access for the neighbors to get to their homes -- they could only enter the street by foot.<br />
<br />
"[The home is] still actively moving," the Asheville paper reported engineer Marvin Mercer as having told a group of about 50 residents. "The house is creaking and moaning. It's not stable whatsoever."<br />
<br />
But on Tuesday in South Philadelphia, city officials demolished the back of a long vacant and deteriorating house that collapsed the previous night, <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9182671">reported local TV station WPVI</a>. The city had earlier sealed up the front of the house, vacant for 15 years, but not the back because it had been deemed too dangerous even for officials to approach.<br />
<br />
"We've had issues with this [house] since the early 90's -- '91, '92," said block captain Moses Cotton. When asked what the city had done about it in the meantime, Cotton told the Philadelphia TV station, "Zero. Nothing."<br />
<br />
But there's a lot of expense and legal red tape involved in government seizing a home. Philadelphia had simply been fining the owner; now added to his bill will be the $14,000 that taxpayers will pay to have the home demolished.<br />
<br />
If a home near you seems on the verge of collapse, or has fallen onto your own property, don't attempt any clean-up yourself until government officials have given you the go-ahead. Issues of concern are:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Personal safety.</strong> There is danger of additional falling debris. Sure, it could further damage your home, but your personal safety is more important. Don't even go stand next to the aftermath to take photos. If you must have a keepsake for yourself or an image to submit to your favorite <a href="http://realestate.aol.com">online news organization,</a> use a zoom lens standing quite far away from the property itself.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Compromised soil. </strong>As in the case out of Asheville, the soil could be compromised and any additional movement, such as pulling out an axe or a power saw to hack away at wood planks that fell onto your deck, could only upset the balance.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Electrocution. </strong>Live electrical wires could be exposed and you could end up dead or severely injured.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Trespassing on private property.</strong> The city and county officials, in most cases, have a protocol that they need to follow before demolishing a home, and that includes obtaining documentation that allows them to be on the premises. You should keep that in mind. It would be trespassing and probably a destruction of private property if you were to take matters into your own hands<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Having proper homeowners insurance. </strong>As for damage to your own property, you should call your insurance company to ask for advice and <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/on/who-pays-cost-negligent-neighbors-fire/">check on the coverage of your homeowner's policy</a>. Does it say it will cover you if a neighbor's house collapses and damages your property? If the damage came from natural causes, it's likely the insurance will not cover it unless you had special coverage for a payout when there's a natural disaster.<br />

Home inspection is serious business. But home inspectors have a wicked sense of humor. If you need proof, just check out this batch of "Postcards From the Field," the perennially popular feature of the American Society of Home Inspectors. From a wasp's nest the size of a basketball to a DIY electrical job that's truly shocking, home inspectors have seen it all -- and lucky for us, they carry cameras.<br />

Mortgage insurance, also dubbed PMI (an acronym for <a href="http://www.sonomacountymortgages.com/2013/02/mortgage-insurance-avoid-pmi/">private mortgage insurance</a>), can easily be several hundred dollars per month depending on the loan program.<br />
<br />
This added premium makes the cost of homeownership more expensive. However, there is a way to cut your mortgage payment using single-pay mortgage insurance. First, keep in mind that "<a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/02/19-confusing-mortgage-terms-deciphered/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_2&amp;utm_campaign=little_known_mortgage_payment" title="19 Confusing Mortgage Terms Deciphered">loan to value</a>," or LTV, is the amount of money being lent against the value of the house. It's computed by taking the loan amount, divided by home value. It's a critical factor in home lending.<br />
<br />
<strong>When <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/refinancing/">refinancing</a>:</strong><br />
o. Mortgage insurance must be removed by the the lender by law at 75 percent loan to value/25 percent home-equity.<br />
o. Mortgage insurance may be removed by the lender at 80% loan to value/20% home-equity (subject to individual mortgage company discretion).<br />
o. A loan can be refinanced anytime if the lender denies the consumer's request to <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/02/how-to-reduce-your-mortgage-insurance-payment/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;utm_campaign=little_known_mortgage_payment" title="How to Reduce Your Mortgage Insurance Payment">remove the mortgage insurance</a>.<br />
<br />

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">o. </span>Mortgage insurance will be required with less than 20% down, <i>every time.</i><br />
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">o. </span>The average monthly mortgage insurance is based on 70 basis points of the loan amount. For example, on a $200,000 loan, that's $1,400 per year, $116.17 per month respectively<br />
o. More money down creates lower loan to value, lowering amount of basis points for determining my calculation, thus reducing mortgage insurance payment.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is single-pay mortgage Insurance anyway?</strong> It is, in short, an added fee, but with a favorable upside. Most people hate the idea of paying an <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/05/8-key-facts-about-your-mortgage-apr/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_4&amp;utm_campaign=little_known_mortgage_payment" title="8 Key Facts About Your Mortgage APR">extra monthly fee</a> without any direct benefit to them. Consumers don't directly receive a benefit from paying mortgage insurance (despite tax deductibility in some cases), other than the ability to secure lower equity financing.<br />
<br />
Single-pay mortgage insurance allows a consumer to pay upfront a portion of the future mortgage insurance premiums <i>at a discount</i> at the close of escrow rather than financing these monies into their house payment. This improves the ability to qualify by means of a lower debt-to-income ratio, a lower monthly mortgage payment, and a lower cost loan.<br />
<br />
Let's say a consumer is looking at a loan for $300,000, using 70 basis points of the loan amount to estimate monthly mortgage insurance, $175 per month or $2,100 annually. $2,100 a year for five years adds up fast --$10,500 to be exact! The single-pay choice (using an average 1.75 percent of the loan amount) would translate in this case to $5,250 that's paid one time at closing. In other words, in exchange for more upfront overhead, the house payment is reduced by $175 per month. A consumer would recuperate these monies within just a little more than two years.<br />

<strong>Single-Pay Mortgage Insurance Pros and Cons</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Pros:</strong><br />
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">o. </span>Lower cost of funds<br />

<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong><br />
o. Higher upfront overhead required. An average of approximately 1.75 percent of the loan amount would be paid at closing.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">o. </span>The loan would have to be kept for at least the amount of time necessary to recuperate paying upfront overhead; paying off the loan earlier negates the benefit.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">o. </span>The option isn't offered by all mortgage companies, so ask your lender upfront if they offer single-pay mortgage insurance as an option to keeping your new payment lower.<br />

<i><strong>Consumer Tip:</strong> Further requirements include a <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/07/what-really-influences-your-credit-score/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_5&amp;utm_campaign=little_known_mortgage_payment" title="What Really Influences Your Credit Score?">middle credit score</a> of least 700 or higher, primary home or secondary home financing only, a max 45 percent debt-to-income ratio and an approval from the lender.</i> Single-pay mortgage insurance offers consumers any easier more flexible way to secure financing and keep <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/02/the-quick-formula-to-determine-your-house-payment/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_6&amp;utm_campaign=little_known_mortgage_payment">the long-term mortgage payment</a> more manageable against a household budget. If homebuyers or homeowners have the equity or cash available, single-pay mortgage insurance makes securing higher loan-to-value financing more manageable as a PMI payment would <i>never</i> be required.<br />

NEW YORK -- When a <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/secrets-home-flippers-housing-boom-back">house is up for sale</a>, professional photos of the property can increase its perceived value by 13 percent, according to a new study by VHT Studios. On a $250,000 home, 13<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> percent </span>equates to a rise of $32,500.<br />
<br />
A decade ago, <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/selling/how-sell-your-home-remotely" target="_blank">real estate sales</a> involved pounding a sign in the yard and <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/realtor-dead">securing an agent</a> to mail out postcards and place newspaper ads. Today it requires a considerable amount of <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/can-hot-realtor-get-you-more-bang-your-buck-0">Internet and image savoir faire</a>. "If you haven't been in the real estate market for five or 10 years, you may be surprised how much the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/guides/buy/">homebuying</a> experience has changed thanks to the Internet," said Brian Balduf, Chairman, VHT Studios, a firm that provides photography and digital marketing for homes and businesses.<br />
<br />
The housing recovery is well under way prompting many to dream of pocketing a profit from <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/home+selling+tips/">selling their homes</a>. Technology, however, has forever changed the way homes are sold post 2008. <span style="font-size: 14px;">VHT's consumer survey reported that 80</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"> percent</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"> of buyers find their homes online. </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">"Buyers use iPads and tablets to shop online and compare homes for sale," Balduf said. "They scan hundreds of listings, looking for properties that catch the eye."</span><br />
<br />
To maximize the sales price of your home, consider the tips below:<br />
<br />
1. <strong>Use a <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2011/03/18/real-estate-photographer-speeds-home-sales/">professional photographer</a>. </strong>The cost of hiring a professional photographer could be well worth the investment. "Selling your home has become an online beauty contest," Balduf said. "Buyers are visually-oriented. So sellers need to provide the best possible pictures of their house on the Internet to grab buyers' attention and motivate them to set up a showing."<br />
<br />
2. <strong>Post a <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2011/09/13/real-estate-videos-go-hollywood/">video of your home</a> on YouTube. </strong>About 21 <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">percent</span> of buyers look for videos online. "Grabbing the attention of Web-savvy buyers requires professional-quality photographs, publishing a video on YouTube.com and providing interactive floor plans," Balduf said.<br />
<br />
3. <strong>Include <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2013/01/09/13-ways-to-sell-your-home-in-2013/">floor plans</a> in your listing.</strong> Interactive floor plans that show how rooms relate to each other are an increasingly popular marketing tool. "Some brokerages have begun making interactive floor plans standard," Balduf said. "The combination of floor plans and professionally taken photos creates the ultimate shopping experience for buyers."<br />
<br />
4. <strong><a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/clutter/">Clear out clutter</a>.</strong> Your house will show better if it's clean and well-organized. Potential buyers are interested in buying a home not furnishings. "Take a minimalist approach and clear out personal items around the house, such as piles of paperwork, books, houseplants and photos," said Balduf.<br />
<br />
5. <strong><a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/choosing+a+real+estate+agent/">Select an agent</a> who knows how to create a perception that draws more buyers to a listing.</strong> "It's obvious from even a cursory glance at real estate listings that some agents overlook the importance of good quality photographs and videos but homebuyers don't," Balduf said.<br />

Much like roofing projects, plumbing is generally a task that's better left to the professionals. But if you're determined to flex your DIY muscles on those pipes and tubes (and save some money while you're at it), we have some useful tips for fixing some common, minor problems without having to call a plumber.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fixing a running toilet:</strong> This is a surprisingly straightforward homeowner fix that doesn't usually require a professional plumber, even if you don't have any plumbing experience, according to <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/plumbing/toilet-repair/how-to-fix-a-running-toilet/view-all" target="_blank">Family Handy Man</a>. The main cause of a running toilet is a leaky flapper valve. A fast remedy is to simply install a new flapper (widely available at hardware stores for under $10), ensuring that it creates a watertight seal with the flush valve. <a href="http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/home/repair-leaky-toilet-flapper.htm" target="_blank">TLC</a> offers a step-by-step guide on how to fix a leaky toilet flapper.<br />
<br />
Flapper seem to work OK? It could also be your toilet's ballcock or refill tube. <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20260513,00.html" target="_blank">This Old House</a> takes you through the fixes in each scenario.<br />
<br />
<strong>Snaking a drain: </strong>Tired of calling a plumber to snake your clogged main drainpipe? Snaking a drain is a pretty painless task, particularly if you have the right tools on hand. DIY Network recommends getting a jetting machine, which will break through clogs in the pipe. Jetting or drain cleaning machines can be purchased <a href="http://www.gorlitz.com/products/water_jetting_machines.asp" target="_blank">online</a>. Once you've removed the cover from the cleanout on the main drain, it's just a matter of securing the hose and turning on the machine. <a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/how-to-snake-the-main-drain/index.html" target="_blank">DIY Network</a> offers a step-by-step guide on how to snake the main drain.<br />
<br />
For less severe clogs in say, bathroom drainpipes, a sewer snake and a plunger are effective options. <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/plumbing/drain-repair/how-to-clear-clogged-drains/view-all" target="_blank">Family Handy Man</a> offers a step-by-step guide on how to fix minor drain clogs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fixing a leaky kitchen faucet. </strong>According to <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/intro/0,,20176670,00.html" target="_blank">This Old House</a>, a homeowner with a little wherewithal and a good wrench should be able to fix a leaky single-handed faucet in half an hour. It's just a matter of disassembling the cartridge faucet to assess the cause of the leak -- in many cases, a defective O-ring -- and replacing the old parts. <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/intro/0,,20176670,00.html" target="_blank">This Old House</a> has a step-by-step guide on how to fix a drippy kitchen faucet.<br />
<br />
Don't have a cartridge faucet? <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/plumbing/faucet-repair/how-to-repair-a-kitchen-faucet/step-by-step" target="_blank">Family Handy Man</a> also offers DIY guides on how to fix rotary ball and ceramic disc faucets.<br />

Doing roofing projects and repairs can be challenging -- and downright dangerous -- if the proper safety measures aren't taken. Though Mark Graham of the <a href="http://www.nrca.net/" target="_blank">National Roofing Contractors Association</a> advises that most <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/roofing/">roofing projects</a> -- from heavy-duty, complex installations to smaller projects like fixing leaks -- should be handled by a roofing professional, there are some precautions that homeowners can take if they decide to go down the DIY route.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 1: Don't go it alone.</strong> If you must do roof repairs or projects, do it with a buddy. Not only can the extra pair of hands help with, say, moving large quantities of heavy shingles, but having someone to discuss and work through issues with can be helpful as well. Most importantly, if an accident should happen, there will be someone there to help you.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 2: If you must do repairs alone, use a safety system. </strong>Install <a href="http://www.lowes.com/Building-Supplies/_/N-1z13cih/pl?Ntt=roof+brackets#!" target="_blank">roof brackets</a> before engaging in any serious work up there, or even better, invest in a <a href="http://www.centennialexteriors.com/tag/roofing-harness-system/" target="_blank">roofing harness system</a>. According to <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/DIY-Projects/Home-Safety/Working-Safely/how-to-properly-use-a-roof-safety-harness/View-All" target="_blank">Family Handy Man</a>, a safety harness and rope tied to something sturdy is the "next best thing to a parachute" and can save your life in the case of a fall.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 3: Check the weather.</strong> Avoid doing projects or repairs on excessively windy or rainy days. Under no circumstances should you work on a wet, icy or snow-covered roof: It's downright dangerous.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 4: Invest in safety gear. </strong>Being on a roof puts the body in positions that are uncomfortable or unsafe. That said, <a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/remodeling/top-10-roofing-tips/pictures/page-2.html" target="_blank">DIY Network</a> suggests wearing soft, rubber-soled boots to provide the best roof traction. Always wear a helmet to protect your head and minimize injury if you fall. <a href="http://www.roofingnetworks.com/info/diy-roof-repair/" target="_blank">Roofing Networks</a> also suggests wearing safety glasses and gloves.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 5: Prepare a checklist and make sure you know what you're doing, and in what order. </strong>Before tackling a massive roofing project or repair, organize yourself ahead of time so you have a clear head when you're up there. There's nothing worse than feeling frazzled or realizing you're lacking the tools needed when you're stuck in a precarious position on a steep roof.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip No. 6: Clean up as you go.</strong> Keep the site clear of debris and other objects while you work. Nails, old shingles and stray tools can create a hazard. If you're not using tools, get your buddy to remove them from the work site to prevent a slipping or tripping danger.<br />
<br />
If at any point in time you don't feel confident or comfortable doing your own repairs, Graham advises you <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2012/03/30/10-home-fixes-that-require-a-pro/">consult a professional</a>. "It's not worth the risk -- leave complicated roofing repairs to the trained professional," he said.<br />

And in the country's most competitive markets, the process can be a blood sport. No matter where you want to hang your hat, experts advise being realistic about expectations and budget. There's nothing worse than falling in love with a neighborhood you can't afford.<br />
<br />
When budget is an issue, experts suggest looking for an area with the same attributes as your dream 'hood, but at a lower cost. If you've fallen in love with the leafy but pricey streets of brownstone <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/rental-listings?svar_SEARCHEVENT=yes&amp;category=rentals&amp;loc=Brooklyn%2C+NY&amp;minPrice=&amp;maxPrice=&amp;bedrooms=all&amp;bathrooms=all">Brooklyn</a>, for instance, you may find your money stretching farther in <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/rental-listings?svar_SEARCHEVENT=yes&amp;category=rentals&amp;loc=Jersey+City%2C+NJ&amp;minPrice=&amp;maxPrice=&amp;bedrooms=all&amp;bathrooms=all">Jersey City</a>, a lower-profile neighborhood with a similar vibe -- and, depending on where you land, killer views of <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/rental-listings?svar_SEARCHEVENT=yes&amp;category=rentals&amp;loc=New+York%2C+NY&amp;minPrice=&amp;maxPrice=&amp;bedrooms=all&amp;bathrooms=all">Manhattan</a>.<br />
<br />
"I recommend people be open to areas other than Manhattan and to other parts of Brooklyn that are commuter-friendly," says Eric Benaim, founder of <a href="http://modernspacesnyc.com/" target="_blank">Modern Spaces</a>, a Long Island City-based real estate firm.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Louise Jordan" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/realestate.aol.com/blog/media/2013/05/louisejordan.jpg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 4px; float: left;" />For Louise Jordan (pictured at left), 35, an account director with a public relations firm, that meant looking outside New York City. She had lived in the city for 11 years before moving to Sweden with her now-fiance for 16 months. When they returned to New York, they settled in the Brooklyn neighborhood of <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Greenpoint/">Greenpoint</a> but soon found themselves wanting to replicate their quieter, greener situation in Gothenburg.<br />
<br />
"Once I got back to New York, I was overwhelmed by how crowded and dirty it was [compared to Sweden]," she said. "I wanted to continue working in Manhattan but have my outdoor space." After looking around, they settled on the town of <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/rental-listings?svar_SEARCHEVENT=yes&amp;category=rentals&amp;loc=Irvington%2C+NY&amp;minPrice=&amp;maxPrice=&amp;bedrooms=all&amp;bathrooms=all">Irvington</a>, just north of the city. There, they spread out in two bedrooms and two bathrooms, in a complex surrounded by nature and bike trails -- a luxury they couldn't afford in their former, hip Brooklyn neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Considering an alternate neighborhood may also ease some of the stress of competition. Jordan recalled feeling pressured to take an apartment in <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/East+Village/">Manhattan's East Village</a> because her broker assured her that the place would be gone within minutes. In super-hot neighborhoods, it's not uncommon to come to a showing with a checkbook in hand, a <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/credit+report/">credit report</a> and references.<br />
<br />
"If you come unprepared, they're not interested in you," Jordan said. "You have to prove yourself, because [landlords] can pick anyone." Benaim suggested that smaller landlords in lesser markets may be more lenient.<br />
<br />
That was the case for Tina Awad, 52, who, after living in downtown Manhattan for 13 years, moved nearly 100 blocks north. A massage therapist who has her own business, Awad was in search of a rental where she could devote one room to patient care. Priced out of downtown, where most of her clientele lived, she sought an alternate neighborhood with good transportation. Her other challenge: Because she runs her own business, she lacked many of the employment documents that most landlords required for a background check.<br />
<br />
But by seeking an independent landlord, she found one who reviewed her tax returns, found her income adequate and rented her a two-bedroom apartment on West 104th Street. "I think an owner-operated kind of building is more flexible, as opposed to the kind that has a doorman and all the brouhaha," she said.<br />

<br />
I'm a <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2008/03/26/fabulous-hardwood-floor-finishes">hardwood floors</a> gal all the way. I love the rich colors and patterns that come from natural wood, and there's just something about a good game of sock hockey in the kitchen that gets me every time. Yet I'll admit --- it's sometimes tricky to clean hardwood floors. After all, how do you reach those cracks and crevices between the planks?<br />
<br />
Turns out that if you follow a few ground rules, you'll have shiny, gleaming wood floors worthy of a palace.<br />

<a href="http://www.learnvest.com/2013/04/how-one-woman-created-a-zero-waste-home/" target="_blank"><strong>By Lisa M. Gerry</strong></a><br />
<br />
Five years ago, <a href="http://zerowastehome.blogspot.com/p/about.html" target="_blank">Bea Johnson</a> and her husband and two sons (all pictured above) were looking for a home closer to the restaurants, shops and school in their coastal <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/california-homes-for-sale/">California</a> town. During the year they spent house hunting, the family of four moved into a small <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/rentals/">apartment</a>, took only the possessions that were absolutely necessary and left the rest in storage. "After living with just the necessities, we realized that we had much more time to spend with our family when we weren't spending it caring for a large house and lots of belongings," says Johnson.<br />
<br />
Then, when they did decide on a house, they chose one that was half the size of their previous home and simplified by selling most of their old stuff. Around that time, Johnson and her husband began investigating environmental issues. "We read books, watched documentaries, and what we learned worried us and made us sad for our kids' futures," she says. "So we decided to do something about it. My husband quit his job to start a sustainability consulting company, and I tackled greening our house."<br />
<br />
<img alt="zero waste home disposables jar" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/realestate.aol.com/blog/media/2013/04/johnson-trash.jpg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 4px; float: left;" />It was then that Johnson devised a system to reduce the family's garbage: She calls it the Zero Waste Home. She started by swapping everything disposable in their home (paper towels, water bottles, grocery bags) for reusables. Today, she says, her family's yearly waste can fit in a quart-size jar (pictured at left). She spoke with us about how to get started, her zero-waste strategies and the one sustainable habit she's just not down with.<br />
<br />

No. Actually, there were no blogs or really anything about being zero waste, so I had to test everything for myself -- I did a lot of Googling. Today, the zero-waste lifestyle is easy for us -- we don't even think about it. But [when we were getting started], we had to experiment to find what our limitations were.<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the basic tenets of the zero-waste lifestyle?</strong><br />
<br />
What we do is based on what we call "The Five R's," which should be applied in order.<br />
<br />
1. Refuse whatever we do not need. For example, junk mail and freebies.<br />
<br />
2. Reduce what we do need by donating or selling anything that isn't absolutely necessary for us to live comfortably.<br />
<br />
3. Reuse by buying second-hand, swapping disposable items for reusable items, and shopping with reusable packaging.<br />
<br />
4. Recycle. By this point, if you've applied the first three R's, you should be left with very little recycling. For example, what's left in our recycling bin are bottles of wine that friends bring over and papers sent home from our sons' school.<br />
<br />
5. Rot. Compost anything that can be composted.<br />
<br />
<strong>How did your sons react to the change in your lifestyle?</strong><br />
<br />
Our sons [ages 13 and 11] didn't even know we were doing zero waste until we pointed it out to them. To them, what we do is totally normal. And, the kids have really enjoyed the simplicity aspect of the lifestyle. It clears their heads, keeps them focused, and they say it's much easier to clean their rooms.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is your process for grocery shopping?</strong><br />
<br />
For my weekly grocery run, I bring what I call my shopping kit: three totes, five glass jars (one each for meat, fish, solid cheese, grated cheese and deli meat for the kids' lunches), two different sizes of cloth bags for dried bulk goods and mesh bags for produce. I buy olive oil, honey, peanut butter, cereal, snacks -- almost everything -- from the bulk section in our grocery store where the items are unpackaged. I buy grated cheese from the salad bar and, every week, I ask for 10 baguettes unpackaged from the bakery. I put them in a pillowcase and then cut them in half, freeze them and then thaw them out as we need them. The produce section is also great for unpackaged foods. The only food that my family eats with disposable packaging is butter -- that's it. We tried making our own butter, but we found that it was not a sustainable option for us.<br />

	Springtime is upon us, and you know what that means. Well, yeah, all that spring cleaning, but now's a great time to do something else with your home: give it a makeover. You may be considering repainting your home, buying new furniture or even going all the way with a remodel. You may also think you know what you're doing -- when you actually don't. In the video clip above, HGTV design expert <a href="http://sabrinasoto.com/" target="_blank">Sabrina Soto</a> dispels some common myths about home makeovers and explains what NOT to do when redesigning your home.<br />
	<br />
	Here's what you definitely can do, though, that doesn't take a lot of time (or money): update your home accents by switching out your drawer and door hardware, spot-paint boo-boos and scratches on bed frames and walls, and use decorative paper to cover the switch plates on electrical outlets that complement your decor scheme. These are just a few <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2013/01/08/quick-and-easy-home-makeovers-for-the-new-year/">quick and easy home makeovers</a> you can do in a flash and on the cheap.<br />
	<br />
	Soto has much more advice on home makeovers besides what not to do. <a href="http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/spring-home-decor-tips/513817df02a7601f70000009" target="_blank">Watch the full segment on Huffington Post Live</a>, where we even asked her a question of our own: What room is the easiest and cheapest to makeover? We weren't expecting the answer she gave. And since we're on the topic of home makeovers, click through the gallery below to see some of the best and worst we've ever seen.<br />

Say you're going on a first date or a job interview. There's one piece of advice you can expect to get from just about everyone: Make a good first impression. Well, if you're hoping to court a buyer for the home you're selling, that rule still applies. You wouldn't let a prospective boss (or the man or woman you're trying to impress) see you for the first time with an untucked shirt and bed head. So don't let potential buyers see your home at anything less than its best. Dress your home to impress.<br />
<br />
" 'You never get a second chance to make a first impression' is as true in real estate as it is in life," said HGTV's Tom Pastillo. But this goes beyond the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/declutter/" target="_blank">obvious decluttering</a> (which we hope you do know you should do). It's about neutralizing your home so any potential buyers who come through have the best chance of visualizing themselves living there.<br />
<br />
Put away all your family photos, children's toys, trinkets and anything personal that buyers could be turned off by. Why are family photos such a big deal. Well, if you walked into a home and saw photos of the family who lives there all over the place, what would you think? Probably: "Oh, what a lovely home <em>they</em> have." Not: "Oh, what a lovely home <em>I could have</em>."<br />
<br />
Wanna go the extra mile to really get the job done and get your home sold? First impressions are everything, so watch the video above to see more things that you could be doing to your home to make buyers fall in love at first sight.<br />
