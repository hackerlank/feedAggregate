The mansion wrapped in plastic is not part of a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/christo">Christo art installation</a> -- those are only temporary. The 20,000-square-foot house in Cherry Hill, N.J., that's owned by a four-time Grammy-winning singer reportedly has been under construction since 2008 with apparently no end in sight -- just the sight of it under a lot of clear plastic, from the chimney to its foundation. Cherry Hill residents are now complaining that the home (pictured above) has become an eyesore with a negative impact on the neighborhood.<br />

"I can't imagine why someone would leave it like this," Realtor Anne Koons, who is selling a property down the street, told <a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/10/14/plastic-covered-mansion-considered-an-eyesore-in-cherry-hill/" style="color: rgb(7, 130, 193); font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">TV station KYW in Philadelphia</a>. It's owned by singer Deniece Williams (pictured at right), perhaps best known for the disco hit "Let's Hear It for the Boy," who the <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Why_is_there_a_plastic-covered_mansion_in_Cherry_Hill.html">Philadelphia Inquirer</a> said halted construction on it in 2010. Property records reveal that Williams, also a noted gospel performer, and her then-husband acquired the property for $425,000 in 2002. At the time it held a 2,300-square-foot home built in 1954.<br />
<br />
As seen in the TV station's video below, neighbor Klara Alperstein calls the home depressing, an eyesore, and speculates that <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/mold/">mold</a> is growing beneath its graying, fraying plastic. Another of those living nearby is Cherry Hill's mayor, Chuck Cahn. "As a neighbor, obviously, he wants to see it sold or completed and brought up to neighborhood standards," said Bridget Palmer, a township spokesperson speaking on his behalf.<br />
<br />
The newspaper reported that when the township communicated with Williams in 2012, the singer said that she would finish the construction. Meanwhile, <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/building+permits/">building permits</a> for the home are still valid, it's been compliant with all laws, and payment on its property taxes are up-to-date, according to KYW. As a result, there reportedly is little that town officials can do.<br />
<br />
While it's unexplained what brought <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Residential+Construction/">construction</a> to a stop in Williams' case, the timing falls in line with the Great Recession and the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/housing+crisis/">collapse of the housing market</a> that halted so much <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/home+building/">homebuilding</a> -- perhaps most notoriously billionaire <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/David+Siegel/">David Siegel's "Versailles</a>," which was designed to be America's largest private home.<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON -- Average U.S. rates on fixed mortgages rose slightly this week, staying near three-month lows. Rates could fall next week now that lawmakers reached a deal to avert a possible government debt default and reopen the federal government.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/index.html" target="_blank">Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday</a> that the average rate on the 30-year loan increased to 4.28 percent from 4.23 percent last week. The average on the 15-year fixed loan edged up to 3.33 percent from 3.31 percent.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/mortgage+rates/" target="_blank">Mortgage rates</a> began falling last month after the Federal Reserve held off slowing its $85-billion-a-month in bond purchases. The bond buys are intended to keep longer-term interest rates low, including mortgage rates. And rates stayed relatively low during the 16-day partial government shutdown.<br />
<br />
Rates are likely to fall even lower now that <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/congress/" target="_blank">Congress</a> reached a deal to reopen the government and allow the Treasury to borrow normally until early February.<br />
<br />
Mortgage rates tend to follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The 10-year note fell to 2.61 percent Thursday, down from 2.74 percent Tuesday.<br />
<br />
To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country Monday through Wednesday each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.
<ul>
	<li>The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was steady at 0.7 point. The fee for a 15-year loan also was unchanged at 0.7 point.</li>
	<li>The average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage slipped to 2.63 percent from 2.64 percent and the fee held at 0.4 point.</li>
	<li>The average rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage rose to 3.07 percent from 3.05 percent. The fee was unchanged at 0.4 point.</li>
</ul>

<br />
The number of distressed properties last month decreased 27 percent from September 2012, with a little less than 1.3 million properties in some stage of foreclosure (default, auction or bank owned). That's one in every 998 <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/10/whats-the-worst-kind-of-debt/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_1&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="What's the Worst Kind of Debt?">homes in foreclosure</a> across the nation. Data from real estate site <a href="http://www.realtytrac.com/statsandtrends">RealtyTrac</a> showed that while foreclosures were up 2 percent from August, filings have continued to fall over the course of this past year. Prices of those foreclosed homes have also declined, in conjunction with rising values of non-distressed properties, resulting in a more significant discount.<br />
<br />
In August, the most recent sales data available on RealtyTrac, the discount on <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/04/a-foreclosure-is-killing-my-credit-what-do-i-do/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="A Foreclosure Is Killing My Credit, What Do I Do?">foreclosed homes</a> was 39.5 percent, or an average of $73,900. That's an increased discount of $3,900 (5.6 percent) from last year, at a median sale price of $113,000. The median sale price for a non-distressed property in August was $186,900.<br />
<br />
But the news isn't good everywhere.<a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/09/credit-mistakes-retirement/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_4&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="7 Credit Mistakes That Could Wreck Your Retirement"> Foreclosure activity</a> spiked 104 percent in Nevada from July to August, as it overtook <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/08/florida-still-the-top-foreclosure-state/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_5&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="Florida: Still the Top Foreclosure State">Florida</a> as the state with the most foreclosures. It remained on top in September with activity increasing 44 percent from August. With 1 in every 249 properties in foreclosure, Nevada's foreclosure rate is up 97 percent from September 2012.<br />
<br />
Florida, Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey join Nevada as the five states with the highest <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/08/repo-men-clear-out-the-wrong-house/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_6&amp;utm_campaign=foreclosure_rate_down" title="When Repo Men Clear Out the Wrong House">foreclosure rates</a>. In June, 1 in every 328 Florida homes had a foreclosure filing, and the rate has declined to 1 in 406 in September.<br />

<br />
Long before British <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/graffiti+artist/">graffiti artist</a> Banksy and his air of mystery arrived in New York City this month, local street artists converged on a graffiti mecca in Queens to showcase their creations. But that mecca, known as 5Pointz, was slated to be razed to make way for luxury apartments. Lawyers are set to argue on Thursday in court after a group of 16 artists sued to preserve their street art.<br />
<br />
A city block in the Queens neighborhood of <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/home-values-listings/Long-Island-City_NY">Long Island City</a> has grown into a popular tourist destination in New York over the past several years. It's even included in more than 100 international travel guides, with hundreds of tourists visiting in any given week, the lawsuit states. Artist Jonathan Cohen, who tags under the name Meres One, said the property owner has allowed aerosol artists to decorate the interior and exterior of the building's walls since 1993, according to a lawsuit filed on Oct. 10 with the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. Until a court decides on the matter, oral arguments for a temporary injunction are set to take place Thursday to stop the destruction of the five-story building and surrounding area.<br />
<br />
The owner, Gerald Wolkoff and his firm G&amp;M Realty, want to make way for a 1,000-unit luxury apartment complex, the lawsuit claims. But Cohen and other artists are asserting in court that they have copyright ownership over their works under the Visual Artists Rights Act, or VARA, and copyright law. Wolkoff and G&amp;M Realty did not respond to multiple requests for comment.<br />
<br />
"We want the judge to stop the destruction of <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2009/12/15/graffiti-artists-losing-ground-in-new-york/">5Pointz</a>, which is tantamount to the Louvre for artists," said Roland Acevedo, a pro-bono attorney for Cohen and the artists. Acevedo said the artists are proposing to buy the property, which is viewed by thousands of commuters along the 7 subway train, at fair market value. Cohen said in court papers that some estimates of the property are around $40 million, though the landlord has claimed it is worth $200 million.<br />
<br />
"I certainly understand that this is the United States and this country was founded on the concept of <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/property+rights/">property ownership</a>," Acevedo said. "We understand that he has a piece of valuable property that belongs to him and his family. No one is going to deprive him of that."<br />
<br />
The owner had only three rules for 5Pointz: no religious art, no profanity and no pornography, court papers noted. Because the artists never signed a release with Wolkoff nor were paid for their work, they are claiming to retain all copyrights to their visual art. "The <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/landlord/">landlord</a> could have protected his property rights to have them sign releases under VARA, but he didn't," Acevedo said.<br />
<br />
The attorney said that the artists say they can raise the money to purchase the property. "The property is basically run down and needs a lot of work inside," Acevedo said. "It's not as if it's a valuable piece of property in and of itself. These artists are the ones who have maintained the property to fix stuff and make sure vandals don't get in. They're there all the time. They make sure things are locked. They give tours there. It's a phenomenal place."<br />
<br />
Cohen, who could not be reached for comment, personally has more than 100 works of art on the exterior and interior walls of 5Pointz, some of which have copyright registration pending before the U.S. Copyright Office, the lawsuit claims.<br />
<br />
Cohen said he has been a volunteer curator of the area since 2002, the lawsuit states, and the owner gave Cohen keys and "several secure spaces" to use as an office and to store cans of spray paint, ladders and other painting supplies. Cohen started a nonprofit corporation called 5Pointz Aerosol Arts Center Inc. with the website <a href="http://5ptz.com/" target="_blank">5ptz.com</a>. The group showcases the works of visual art at 5Pointz and "publicizes the free community events sponsored by 5Pointz," the lawsuit states.<br />
Artists have traveled from Japan, Kazakhstan, Australia and Brazil for the opportunity to paint their works at 5Pointz, knowing that having their work at 5Pointz work "adds considerable prestige to an artist's reputation," the lawsuit states.<br />
<br />
"You can't just come and paint on the walls," Acevedo said. "You have to go through Jonathan Cohen. He doesn't police it like a library. He's generous in giving permission." But you have to show Cohen a sketch of your proposed work.<br />
<br />
Acevedo said the artists had considered moving the artwork to another location, but he said it would be difficult to take apart a stone concrete wall and stairwells from a five-story building. "This is not a canvas that can be easily moved," he said.<br />
<br />
When asked if Cohen or any of the artists might demand financial compensation for their damaged visual work, Acevedo said it might be possible, given that VERA has statutory damages in the law that range from $750 to $150,000 per piece, if the damage is willful. "We are asking the court to enjoin the landlord from destroying any more pieces of works," Acevedo said. "They've damaged a number of works already. We've asked court to stop destruction of work and building until the court can hear and decide this matter."<br />

<br />
U.S. homebuilders were less confident in the housing market in October, reflecting their uncertainty over the budget impasse in Washington.<br />
<br />
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index <a href="http://www.nahb.org/news_details.aspx?newsID=16484" target="_blank">slipped two points</a> to 55. The September reading was revised down from an initial reading of 58.<br />
<br />
Measures of current sales conditions for single-family homes, builders' outlook over the next six months and traffic by prospective buyers all fell from September. The partial <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/government+shutdown/" target="_blank">government shutdown</a> has made it harder for some buyers to close on their <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/mortgages/" target="_blank">mortgages</a>, raising concerns that a prolonged shutdown could undercut the strength of the housing recovery.<br />
<br />
Still, builders remain optimistic that the recovery will endure. Any reading above 50 indicates more builders view sales conditions as good, rather than poor.<br />

<strong>By <a href="http://money.usnews.com/topics/author/abby_hayes">Abby Hayes</a></strong><br />
<br />
Repainting a room is a quick way to <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2012/11/26/secrets-of-successful-house-flippers">freshen up your home</a>, but at $30 a gallon, premium paint is no picnic -- especially considering that a mid-sized bedroom could require two to three gallons.<br />
If you're ready for a new look, but don't have a lot of money to splurge, these seven tips will help you update your wall colors without spending a fortune.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Check your local recycling center. </strong>Recycling and hazardous waste centers usually take paint from local business owners who need to throw out old, unused paint. Since paint has a long shelf life, much of the paint that is thrown away in these centers is still good. And the best part is you can usually pick up this <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/09/23/5-strategies-for-scoring-freebies">paint for free</a>!<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Stop by the hardware store frequently. </strong>Hardware stores, paint specialty stores and even Walmarts usually have a mistints section where they sell discolored paint for a fraction of the cost. At Lowe's, for instance, you can pick up a $35 gallon of premium paint for under $15. You never know what you'll find, but it's worth swinging by this section of your local store.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Invest in better paint. </strong>When it comes to paint, you really do get what you pay for. Though you might not want to spring on the most expensive paint, the higher-end paints cover better, which means you use less paint, and they're less messy (so no accidental drips on the floor that <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2013/06/25/how-to-decorate-an-apartment-without-forfeiting-your-security-deposit">could cost to clean up</a>later). They also tend to be more durable, making your new paint job last longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Use primer. </strong>There are times when you don't have to use primer, but if you're painting raw wood, raw drywall, stained surfaces or rough surfaces, you'll definitely need to use primer. Also, if you're painting a dark color or dramatically changing the color of your walls, primer will help your paint cover better, so you use less. Typically, one coat of primer and one coat of paint will be cheaper than two or three coats of paint.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Learn to paint like a professional.</strong> Inexperienced painters tend to try to squeeze all the paint out of a roller every time. It seems like this would make sense, since you use all the paint you put on the roller. But rolling on thicker layers with a lighter touch actually uses less paint and looks more professional.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Buy in bulk.</strong> Buying paint in five-gallon cans is cheaper than buying it in one-gallon cans. Typically, a 5 gallon bucket of paint will cost about the same as four one-gallon buckets -- so you get a whole gallon for free. If you're painting a lot of square footage, choosing a single color to use on most of the walls can <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/slideshows/8-painless-ways-to-save-money">save you a lot of money</a>. You could also talk to your local paint store about buying several one-gallon buckets of paint at a bulk price.<br />
<br />
<strong>7. Cover your rollers and brushes.</strong> Sometimes it takes a few days to complete a larger painting project. If you have to quit before you're done with a paint color, don't rinse out those brushes and rollers. That's just a waste of time and paint! Instead, wrap them tightly in plastic bags, tied with a rubber band or some twine. When you're ready to resume painting the next day, just unwrap your rollers, and go.<br />
<br />
But the easiest way to save on paint? Buy less. If you're really on a tight budget, consider simply <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2012/10/03/1003mymoney2">redecorating your home</a> with an accent wall instead of painting the entire room. Another excellent way to upgrade the look of a room -- especially if you still like the overall color scheme -- is to paint the ceiling a lighter version of the wall color, instead of just a boring ceiling white.<br />

Applications for U.S. home loans rose slightly in the latest week as increased refinancing activity offset a decline in demand for purchase loans as the U.S. government shutdown weighed, data from an industry group showed Wednesday.<br />
<br />
The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, rose 0.3 percent in the week ended Oct. 11. That follows a gain of 1.3 percent in the week ended Oct. 4.<br />
<br />
The figures come as the U.S. federal <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/government+shutdown/" target="_blank">government shutdown</a> has cast a spotlight on fiscal policy, with some economists worrying that the stalemate in Congress could drag on the economy.<br />
<br />
That shutdown affected the <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/mortgage/" target="_blank">mortgage</a> market, MBA said.<br />
<br />
"Purchase applications for government programs dropped by more than 7 percent over the week to their lowest level since December 2007, and the government share of purchase applications dropped to its lowest level in almost three years," Mike Fratantoni, MBA's vice president of research and economics, said in a statement.<br />
<br />
MBA data showed 30-year mortgage rates edged up 4 basis points to 4.46 percent, but rates were still down from September when they matched the 4.8 percent high for 2013.<br />
<br />
The refinancing index gained 3.3 percent after recently hitting the lowest level since June 2009. In contrast, the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, fell 4.8 percent.<br />
<br />
The mortgage survey covers more than 75 percent of U.S. retail residential mortgage applications, according to MBA.<br />

You don't need a huge nest egg to retire well, especially if you're willing to move to a place with a low cost of living. Relocating to one of these places could help you to get by on a combination of Social Security and a small amount of savings, or allow you to retire younger or maintain a better lifestyle than you could in a more expensive city.<br />
<br />
To find places where retirees can live well on less than $75 per day, U.S. News analyzed recently released 2012 Census Bureau data. We looked for places where people age 60 and older spend the least on housing, including rent, mortgage payments and other housing costs, and places where retirees spends less than a third of their income on housing. Among the most affordable cities, we selected places with amenities retirees will need, such as medical facilities, services for seniors and recreation options.<br />
<br />
Here are 10 places where it's possible to live well in retirement on less than $75 a day:<br />
<br />
<strong>Akron, Ohio</strong>

<figure class="photo-slim undefined"><img alt="City of Akron" data-caption="Home of LeBron James and Good Year" data-mep="15421" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/4777x2787+0+376/resize/435x250!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/adam/14f8b084289317a867e79f1e7bf6fce3/158805439.jpg" /><figcaption class="cap"><b class="credit">Getty Images/Flickr Open</b></figcaption></figure>
Once known for its rubber production, Akron is now home to the world's largest concentration of polymer research and development, thanks to The University of Akron's College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering. Seniors can get discounts to the Akron Art Museum and Akron Symphony Orchestra, or enjoy the 6,600 acres of metropolitan parks for free. The Akron General Medical Center and Summa Akron City and St. Thomas Hospitals are ranked as high-performing medical centers in a variety of specialties including geriatrics. These amenities are coupled with low housing costs. People age 60 and older pay a median of $1,087 per month with a mortgage, $646 in monthly rent or $420 per month if they own their homes debt free.<br />
<br />
<strong>Augusta, Ga.</strong>

<figure class="photo-slim undefined"><img alt="USA, Georgia, Augusta, Golf Course in autumn" data-caption="USA, Georgia, Augusta, Golf Course in autumn" data-mep="15422" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/4914x2861+0+0/resize/435x250!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/adam/ef4b68e5689a3f46ab71f05b2abc610e/sb10068192f-001.jpg" /><figcaption class="cap"><b class="credit">Marvin E. Newman/Getty Images</b>Augusta, Ga. golf course in autumn.</figcaption></figure>
The best golfers in the world come to Augusta each spring for the Masters Tournament. The low home prices will tempt you to stay. The median monthly housing cost for people age 60 and older is $1,057 among homeowners with a mortgage, just $329 for those who have paid it off and $616 monthly for renters. Located along the Savannah River, this college town is the home of Georgia Regents University, which includes the Medical College of Georgia. Seniors can get discounted admission to the Augusta Museum of History, the Boyhood Home of President Woodrow Wilson and on boat tours of the Augusta Canal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Chattanooga, Tenn.</strong>

Chattanooga is nearly surrounded by mountains, and the Tennessee River flows right through it, offering ample opportunities for outdoor activities. Retirees can take in these views for a median of just $644 in rent, $1,023 in mortgage payments or $353 monthly without a mortgage. The city operates a fleet of zero-emission electric buses that seniors age 65 and older can ride for just 75 cents each way.<br />

<strong>Des Moines, Iowa</strong>

Burl Pierce, 74, a retiree in Des Moines, has season tickets to University of Iowa football games and volunteers three days per week at the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden. "This is my means of helping to expand my knowledge of horticulture, but it's also become rather personal in that you enjoy the camaraderie of the volunteers that you are with," he says. It costs retirees a median of $1,134 in monthly mortgage payments to live in Iowa's state capital. Renters who have paid off their mortgages pay $456 in other monthly housing costs and renters are charged $678. If you're so inclined, you can meet the U.S. presidential candidates when they descend on the state for the Iowa caucus.<br />

<strong>Greenville, S.C.</strong>

<figure class="photo-slim undefined"><img data-caption="The Waterfalls in downtown Greenville." data-mep="15425" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/800x465+0+36/resize/435x250!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/adam/7141a2e907094ab40bdb925ea8c12df7/Fallsatgreenvillesc.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption class="cap"><b class="credit">Wikipedia Commons</b>The Waterfalls in downtown Greenville.</figcaption></figure>
There's no shortage of free things to do in Greenville. You could take a stroll over the Liberty Bridge that curves over and around Reedy River Falls, ride on the Downtown Trolley or visit the Greenville County Museum of Art, all with no admission fee. Housing for people age 60 and older costs a median of $1,027 with a mortgage, $673 in rent and just $290 monthly for older homeowners without mortgages. "Part of the reason we were able to retire as young as we did is because the general cost of living is so much less in South Carolina than it was in California," says Linda Barnett, 57, a retired financial analyst from California who moved to Greenville in 2012. "The townhouse we have here would have cost three to four times that much in California." Barnett now spends her time volunteering for Meals on Wheels and hiking at nearby Jones Gap State Park.<br />
<br />
<strong>Little Rock, Ark.</strong>

Little Rock's Riverfront Park provides 33 acres of parkland along the Arkansas River. Other free things to do include visiting the Arkansas Arts Center and the Historic Arkansas Museum. Retirees who rent pay a median of $627 monthly to live here. Senior homeowners pay a median of $1,064 monthly or $355 without a mortgage. "It's definitely a lot cheaper to live here in Little Rock on the same amount of income than it would be in San Jose," says Cynthia Conger, president of Conger Wealth Management in Little Rock. "An $800,000 home in California would be equivalent to a home that costs $200,000 or less here."<br />

<strong>Louisville, Ky.</strong>

For a median of just $1,052 in monthly mortgage payments or $595 in rent, you could retire in the hometown of the Kentucky Derby. Costs are even lower - a median of $375 monthly - for people age 60 and older who have paid off their mortgages. Louisville's museum row has institutions dedicated to history, sports, art and science where retirees could spend a relaxing afternoon or find interesting volunteer opportunities. And Kentucky residents age 65 and older can take classes at the University of Louisville tuition free.<br />
<br />
<strong>Pittsburgh</strong>

<figure class="photo-slim undefined"><img alt="Skyline with Allegheny river" data-caption="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA" data-mep="15428" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/4992x2914+0+0/resize/435x250!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/adam/97de6f29e38df248445639c371f13570/sb10063310f-001.jpg" /><figcaption class="cap"><b class="credit">Dennis Flaherty/Getty Images</b>Skyline with Allegheny river </figcaption></figure>
Pittsburgh's many professional teams make this city a sports fan's paradise. "I see almost every sport there is around," says Phil Coyne, 95, a retired machine shop worker who now ushers at 60 to 70 Pirates games each year. "I never miss a game. I try not to." There is also a ballet, symphony and enough museums to occupy everyone who prefers other forms of culture. People age 65 and older ride free on the bus, T or Monongahela Incline, thanks to a program paid for by Pennsylvania Lottery proceeds. Another perk of the city includes access to the UPMC-University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is ranked 9th in the nation in geriatrics. Monthly housing prices for seniors are just $1,072 for retirees with mortgages, $422 among people with paid-off houses and $608 for renters.<br />

There is no state income tax in Texas, and housing is often more affordable than in other parts of the county. Renters age 60 and older paid $671 monthly in 2012. Older homeowners paid a median of $1,184 each month toward their mortgages, which drops to $395 among those without housing debt. But watch out for the property taxes. "We do not have a state income tax, so a lot of the income is derived from property tax, which generally is going to be higher," says John Eaton, a certified financial planner for Cypress Wealth Advisors in San Antonio. "We have a very low cost of living, but if you come here and buy similar-cost housing, your taxes could be much higher."<br />

<strong>Syracuse, N.Y.</strong>

While summer and fall can be beautiful in upstate New York, Syracuse is famous for its prolific snowfall, which pelts the city each winter. Snow removal and heating bills can be significant. What you won't worry about are other aspects of the cost of living, which are among the lowest in the county. Renters age 60 and older pay a median of $641 monthly, and homeowners pay $1,119 with a mortgage or $472 monthly once they have paid it off. Once you no longer need to worry about getting to work in the morning, you're free to have a second cup of coffee, look out your window at the pillowy snow drifts and think about all the money you're saving by not retiring in a more expensive area.<br />

<br />
It's impossible to predict the economic consequences of a <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/debt+ceiling/">debt-ceiling</a> breach or government default, since it's never happened (on purpose) before, but experts say one thing is certain: Treasury rates will rise. And that means mortgage rates will follow.<br />
<br />
"Anytime there is a default, the borrower is going to get punished in terms of higher interest rate, and so if the government defaults, that means <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/guides/explanation-mortgage-types/">Treasury rates</a> will also rise and that also pushes up mortgage rates. The housing market is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates," says <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Lawrence+Yun/">Lawrence Yun</a>, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.<br />
<br />
During the first week of October, the yield on four-week Treasury bills rose from around 0.12 percent to 0.36 percent as the yield spread between the interbank overnight lending rate. or LIBOR, and the four-week Treasury bill went negative for the first time since 2001. The average <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/mortgage+rates/">rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage</a> inched up to 4.23 percent from 4.22 percent, Freddie Mac reported last week, the first increase in five weeks.<br />
<br />
Hitting the debt ceiling would reduce demand for U.S. Treasuries, which would lower prices and increase rates. Anthony Hsieh, founder and CEO of online mortgage lender loanDepot, expects <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/home+loans/">home-loan</a> rates to skyrocket by a full percentage point or more overnight if the debt-ceiling is hit, a move he worries would cause people to jump into <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/ARMs/">adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs</a>.<br />
"In the last three years or so, consumers have been spoiled with rates in the high threes to the mid-to-low fours. If we climb into the 5 percent interest rate range, that will create psychological barriers and adjustable rate mortgages will become attractive -- even if they aren't."<br />
He says that as political and financial uncertainty continues to swirl, now might be the time to lock in interest rates. He suggests moving from a one-year ARM to five-year, seven-year or longer, or a 15- or 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.<br />
<br />
ARMs, of course, aren't for everyone, carrying interest rates that change according to a specific benchmark. "What we have seen in the past is consumers with these mortgages are not financially prepared for a rise in interest rates, so if they start with an introductory teaser rate in the 2.5 percent range and then it increases to the 5 percent, 6 percent or 7 percent range in the next three years, that can more than double the initial payment, and they won't be able to afford their home," says Hsieh.<br />
<br />
Adjustable rate mortgages were one of the leading inflators of the most recent <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/housing+bubble/">housing bubble</a> that came crashing down in 2008 when people stopped being able to afford their monthly payments and then defaulted on their loans. It took more than four years for the housing market to regain its footing, and while adjustable rate mortgages are still in play in today's housing market, Yun isn't worried we're going to end up right back where we started.<br />
<br />
"They are around, but it's not a resurgence. People who are taking out these mortgage are qualified individuals with high credit scores and it tends to be over a two- to five-year time period. This isn't like back in 2006 when credit scores weren't checked and loans were blindly being made"<br />
Jed Kolko, chief economist and vice president of analytics at real estate website Trulia, says the insecurity in the marketplace will also keep borrowers away from ARMs.<br />
<br />
"There's so much uncertainty in the political and financial arenas and an ARM, by definition, brings uncertainty since you won't know your payments. The only way they are going to take off again and become appealing is if there is more certainty."<br />

<br />
New requirements for <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/FHA+loans/">Federal Housing Administration-approved mortgages</a> go into effect today, presenting potential roadblocks for homebuyers with collections or judgments in their credit histories. While lenders have recently been able to take significant <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/08/getting-an-fha-loan-just-got-easier/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_1&amp;utm_campaign=FHA_loan_harder" title="Bad Credit? Getting an FHA Loan Just Got Easier">economic events</a> into account in processing loan applications, today's changes are a step in the opposite direction for loan accessibility.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/HUD/">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> issued mortgage letters Aug. 15 instructing lenders to add collections accounts and <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/08/credit-card-judgments-expire/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_2&amp;utm_campaign=FHA_loan_harder" title="Credit Card Judgments: How Long Before They Expire?">judgments</a> to an applicant's debt-to-income ratio, one of the qualifying standards for an FHA loan. Loans made on and after Oct. 15 must follow these guidelines.<br />
<br />
<strong>What Lenders Need to Look At</strong>: Charge-offs and medical collections are not included in these new standards, though they have a negative impact on credit scores and will therefore be factors in consumers' credit-worthiness. For an applicant with more than $2,000 in collections accounts, the lender is required to incorporate those debts into the debt-to-income ratio, because paying those debts may interfere with the ability to make mortgage payments.<br />
<br />
"It's very dramatic because typically FHA has been geared toward people with less than perfect credit," said Eddie Hilliard, a loan originator at Mortgage Acceptance Corp. in Florida. "Now for them to not only have to explain away the collections and judgments but to add them to the debt ratio -- it's really going to put them out of sorts."<br />
<br />
Collections accounts do not need to be paid off in order to qualify for an FHA loan, but judgments do. An exception can be made to the judgment rule if the borrower can arrange a payment schedule.<br />
<br />
<strong>Additional Obstacles:</strong> The squeeze potential <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/homebuyers/">homebuyers</a> may feel will be compounded by another regulation that goes into effect Jan. 10, 2014. As part of the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Dodd-Frank+Act/">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a>, the maximum <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201301_cfpb_ability-to-repay-rule_what-it-means-for-consumers.pdf" rel="nofollow">debt-to-income ratio will be 43%</a>.<br />
<br />
"Now, depending on the Automated Underwriting System findings, you could go as high as 55 percent," Hilliard said. The AUS analyzes completed mortgage applications and applicants' credit histories to generate loan decisions. Some applications are manually underwritten to consider circumstances of the debt, and by the new guidelines, mortgage applications of consumers with disputed credit accounts of more than $1,000 must be manually underwritten.<br />
<br />
Such adjustments are steps toward strengthening the FHA loan program, which has been stressed since helping to fill the gap created by the collapse of the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/subprime+mortgage/">subprime mortgage market</a>.<br />
<br />
In some states, the regulations reach farther. In the nine community property states, even if one goes about the mortgage process alone, a spouse's collections and judgments are factored into the debt-to-income ratio. (Those states are Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.)<br />
<br />
For anyone going for an FHA mortgage, the key is to pay those debts: Any payments that can lower your debt-to-income ratio will help. Take stock of your credit profile by reviewing your <a href="http://www.credit.com/credit-reports/free-annual-credit-report/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_4&amp;utm_campaign=FHA_loan_harder" title="How Do I Get My Free Annual Credit Report?">free annual credit report</a> and ways to strengthen your credit.

<br />
"The best option now is to get ahead and make your debts right," Hilliard said. Try to get a settlement, reach out to that creditor, make payments. You're going to have to start making arrangements to clear that credit up."<br />

Nineteen collegiate teams are in a tough competition to see who can design, build and operate the most energy efficient and affordable home of the future. From <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/solar+power/">solar technology</a>, to <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/sustainable+homes/">sustainable</a> building materials, to futuristic heating and cooling systems, these teams are using the latest innovations from companies across the globe, while pushing the envelope of energy efficiency with their own new ideas. The homes are fully built and decorated, and the student teams are performing all kinds of tasks within the homes, from washing clothes to boiling water; whichever team does it all best wins.<br />
<br />
The competition, which is called the <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Solar+Decathlon/">Solar Decathlon</a>, started in 2002, occurring biannually in Washington, D.C. This year, the <a href="http://www.solardecathlon.gov/index.html" target="_blank">Department of Energy-sponsored event</a> moved to <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/homes-for-sale-listings/Irvine_CA">Irvine, Calif.</a>, to bring its homes to a wider audience. Irvine is the perfect place, as <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/new+construction/">new construction</a> is booming again after a lull during the housing recession. A big emphasis in this year's competition is affordability.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/HomeBuilders/">homebuilders</a> are watching, especially <a data-gdsid="23462" data-inline-quote-symbol="LEN" href="http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/LEN" target="_self">Lennar</a>, which has a major development going on near the site of this year's competition. Lennar is building homes with solar standard.<br />
Below are some highlights of this year's decathlon.<br />

Americans are increasingly willing to spend on <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/09/stay-on-budget-with-a-home-renovation/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_1&amp;utm_campaign=spend_home_improvement">home renovations</a>, according to a survey that says they are taking on more projects and plan to use more expensive materials throughout the process. Remodeling app Planese outlined in a <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wealth-effect-homeowners-excited-about-remodeling-again-226942111.html" rel="nofollow">news release</a> the results of an online survey done with remodelormove.com, in which homeowners were asked roughly 70 questions about their plans to remodel their home or move to a new one. All 5,000 respondents were interested in making some sort of change.<br />
<br />
The results indicate Americans are willing to spend 30 percent of their home's value to remodel, up from 25 percent in 2007 and 28 percent in 2010, though home prices were significantly higher in 2007 and lower in 2010 than they are now. People plan to spend an average of about $102,000 to renovate. How homeowners said they'd use that money offers more insight into the consumer mindset.<br />
<br />
Based on the survey results, those looking to remodel increasingly plan to hire professionals for the work and use more expensive materials for the renovation. And as far as what they're remodeling, homeowners surveyed in 2013 are undertaking more expensive projects by favoring kitchen updates over bathrooms.<br />
<br />
In the news release, Planese CEO and Co-Founder Dan Fritschen added context to the numbers. "Consumers are spending again, which bodes well for the entire home improvement industry," Fritschen said. "More people are feeling secure enough during this economic environment that they are remodeling."<br />
<br />
Home improvement is more than enhancing the aesthetics and comfort of a house, because it can pay off in the long term by adding value to the property. No matter how you finance renovations -- <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/10/house-underwater-a-personal-line-of-credit-can-help/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;utm_campaign=spend_home_improvement">personal loan</a>, savings, <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2012/12/how-helocs-impact-your-credit-score/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_4&amp;utm_campaign=spend_home_improvement">home equity line of credit</a> -- staying on budget is crucial.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to Spend the Budget</strong>: Though 43 percent of those surveyed by Planese said that they planned to be hands-off in the remodeling process (up from 36 percent in 2010 and 2007), a little do-it-yourself work may free up cash for other parts of the project. Nearly two-thirds of homeowners said they planned to hire a general contractor, and 54 percent said they'd hire an architect, up from 64 percent and 47 percent in 2010, respectively.<br />
<br />
The biggest jump in the data seems to be the growing preference for pricey products. In 2007, 9 percent of homeowners said they would use "expensive materials" (the term is undefined in the release), and in 2010 that share was 10 percent. Now, 17 percent expressed a preference for the finer goods. Renovations should be an investment, not a path to debt.<br />
<br />
If you need to take out financing in the form of a home equity line of credit, a personal loan or a credit card, make sure you understand the impact that new credit can have on your credit score. <a href="https://www.credit.com/free-credit-report-card/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_5&amp;utm_campaign=spend_home_improvement">(Credit.com's Credit Report Card</a> will provide your free credit scores and let you see how adding a loan or credit card <a href="http://www.credit.com/credit-scores/all-about-credit-scores/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_6&amp;utm_campaign=spend_home_improvement" title="All About Credit Scores">will impact your credit</a>.)<br />

Nearly a decade after moving to a hotel after losing her home in foreclosure, a Wisconsin woman faces eviction for an unpaid bill of $29,000. Jana Ganjian says that her poor health put her out of a job and then her home, and that she's only stayed at the hotel all this time because she was unable to find a place to rent.<br />
<br />
"I had no vision of staying for nine and a half years," Ganjian told Milwaukee TV station <a href="http://www.wisn.com/news/south-east-wisconsin/racine-kenosha/racine-woman-facing-eviction-after-living-in-hotel-for-9-years/-/10151828/22419422/-/tt7lak/-/index.html?absolute=true&amp;flv=1" target="_blank">WISN</a>, "but with no family, no longer with a home, the hotel became home and the staff became family." <a href="http://journaltimes.com/news/local/nine-years-at-the-marriott/article_8bb14d0c-32cf-11e3-a3ec-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">The Journal Times of Racine</a> quoted her as saying that she's disabled by a disease similar to lupus and "If I could be working, this wouldn't have happened in the first place."<br />
<br />

Ganjian reportedly has been paying $89 a day, with the help of Social Security disability benefits, to stay at the Racine Marriott in Mount Pleasant, but the hotel sought to evict her after she filed for bankruptcy in August. Ganjian said that although she reached the highest level under Marriott's rewards points program, she wasn't allowed to apply those points to her stay. A judge ruled last week that Ganjian must leave the hotel by Oct. 24.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/viewart/20131012/GPG0101/310120376/?flv=1" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a> said that it was unclear how Ganjian managed to stay long enough to accrue such a large bill at the hotel, and that the hotel's general manager, Brian Wismar, declined to discuss Ganjian's situation, as a matter of customer privacy. As seen in the video above, Ganjian's attorney (pictured) says it's also unclear where his client will go after she must leave the Marriott.<br />

A tenant who's complained to news media about abandoned or unsafe homes in his South Bend, Ind., neighborhood has contributed to the problem himself by trashing the house he rented to the point where it's no longer inhabitable, says his former landlady. "Allen told me he would make sure the house was not rentable anymore," Alicia Ortiz said, quoting former tenant Allen Townsend to South Bend TV station <a href="http://www.wndu.com/news/headlines/Landlord-questions-tenants-actions-in-vacant-and-abandon-housing-problem-227301061.html">WNDU</a>. She claimed that Townsend used a 10-day eviction period to do $25,000 in damage to the home.<br />
<br />
"He made true on his promise," Ortiz says in the video below. "It is no longer rentable." The basement was flooded, air-duct grates were removed, appliances were missing, and a stairwell was filled and blocked with trash, the TV station reported, adding that several of the items among the trash had Townsend's name on them -- even though he told its reporter that he had not left any behind.<br />
<br />
Ortiz said that although the home previously needed some upgrading, it had new carpet and was freshly painted when the tenant moved in. After Townsend fell behind in his rent by $900 and refused to pay, she obtained an emergency eviction to get him out.<br />
<br />
The tenant had been quoted in WNDU news stories earlier this year about other homes in the neighborhood, urging the <a href="http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Neighbors-demand-collapsed-building-be-torn-down-210887581.html">demolition of a house with a collapsed roof</a> and calling the city's code officials about a <a href="http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Vacant-home-on-west-side-found-to-have-cracked-foundation-209571631.html">home's foundation caving in</a>. Now the home that Townsend once rented will be added to the demolition list, "because there is way too much damage," said Ortiz.<br />
<br />
It's certainly nothing new for some tenants to trash a rental as they near eviction. In July, AOL Real Estate carried the story of some <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/on/accidental-landlords-non-paying-tenants/">"accidental landlords"</a> in Minnesota who reportedly struggled for months to evict some non-paying tenants. Their tenants then purportedly left behind 66 bags filled with garbage as well as holes in walls, stained carpets and water damage.<br />
<br />
And, of course, such problems aren't limited to renters in America. Recently some tenants with five children and 14 dogs made the news in Great Britain after reportedly leaving a home in such deplorable condition -- littered with dog feces and dirty diapers -- that the <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/tenants-hell-evicted-after-6-month-battle-5633718">Daily Mail</a> said the stench of the place induced vomiting. In Australia, meanwhile, <a href="http://www.examiner.com.au/story/1836280/landlord-faces-15000-bill/">The Examiner</a> newspaper carried a story about tenants who threw a two-day party, advertised on social media and attended by hundreds, that left $15,000 in damage. The landlord reportedly was forced to watch helplessly from his parked car across the street, though -- prevented by tenancy law there from entering the property himself.<br />

<strong>By <a href="http://blog.credit.com/author/mitchell-weiss/">Mitchell D. Weiss</a></strong><br />
<br />
Houses and college degrees have two things in common: Both cost of lot of money and both depend on specialty financing products to help make them more affordable. But which came first? High prices or budget-friendly payment plans? Consider the latest offering in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-18/wealthy-borrowers-sacrifice-upside-for-down-payment-aid.html" rel="nofollow">consumer financial engineering</a>, courtesy of private equity firms and crowdfunding companies.<br />
<br />
The lenders' pitch is Faustianly straightforward as in, "You need cash to fund all or part of your (housing) down payments and college degrees. We have plenty of that and we're willing to let you use some of it in exchange for a piece of the action." It's a takeoff on the corporate venture capital model that goes something like this: most assets lose value -- or <i>depreciate </i>-- over time, as with refrigerators and lawnmowers; houses, however, usually do the opposite. These increase -- or, <i>appreciate </i>-- in value. And sometimes they do so quite rapidly, particularly after a market disruption causes prices to be reset at significantly lower levels.<br />
<br />
In terms of their future earnings potential, people also appreciate in value when they enhance their <i>human capital </i>by acquiring more skills, experience and education. But both these "asset categories" require investment capital to realize their economic potentials. Enter the opportunists.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Magic of Affordable Payments</strong>: In the case of a house, the financial proposition is equity-based -- a percentage of the upside as measured by the difference between the buy- and sell-prices. In the case of the person, it's royalty based, where the payback is a share of his or her future earnings. But why is it that houses and education cost so much? Are these prices purely market-driven (supply versus demand) or is something else going on?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.credit.com/loans/mortgage-questions/how-to-determine-your-down-payment-on-home/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_2&amp;utm_campaign=investor_dream_home" title="How to Determine Your Down Payment on a Home">Housing prices</a> are influenced by many factors including locational attributes (proximity to work, transportation, schools, recreational facilities and so forth), as well as a tax code that rewards indebtedness with mortgage interest-deductibility. However, prices are also boosted through financial alchemy -- creative ways of transforming unaffordability into affordability. <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/09/7-loans-you-thought-had-disappeared/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;utm_campaign=investor_dream_home" title="7 Loans You Thought Had Disappeared">Adjustable-rate mortgages</a> are a good example. Homebuyers are lured by the below-market monthly payments (for now) and the hope of bigger, better, more beautiful houses before the higher payments kick in later on.<br />
<br />
The exorbitant price of higher education is also <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/65667/crowdfunding-higher-education-an-alternative-approach." rel="nofollow">made possible with financing</a>. In this case, favorable payment structures are further enhanced by government and financial services industry policies and practices under which loans are approved, not necessarily because they can be repaid, but rather because they <a href="http://blog.credit.com/2013/09/bankruptcy-student-loan/?utm_source=Yahoo&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_5&amp;utm_campaign=investor_dream_home">cannot be avoided</a>. It's an attitude that's led to an unprecedented expansion on the part of the schools, which in turn has increased the sector's costs and, therefore, the need for even more consumer borrowing as a result.<br />
<br />
Until these market-morphing methods are either corrected with legislation or influenced by more economically-conscious consumer choices (particularly in the case of higher education), homebuyers and students should tread carefully when it comes to financing structures that insidiously encourage over-borrowing.<br />
<br />
<strong>Read the Fine Print, Do the Math:</strong> When it comes to <a href="http://www.credit.com/loans/mortgage-questions/fixed-rate-mortgage-vs-adjustable-rate-mortgage/?utm_source=AOL&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_6&amp;utm_campaign=investor_dream_home" title="Fixed Rate Mortgage vs Adjustable Rate Mortgage">adjustable loans</a>, I suggest projecting the worst-case scenario and see whether your budget can accommodate that. For equity- and royalty-sharing arrangements, devise a series of house- and income-appreciation scenarios, and calculate the APRs for each.<br />
<br />
For example, I read about one company that makes education loans in exchange for a percentage of the borrower's pretax earnings for a 10-year term. The lender also states that it would limit its total payback to five times the original loan value, should the borrower hit the livelihood lottery. The way the math works, if that maximum were to occur during the course of the repayment period (10 years), the loan's APR would be 49 percent. However, if the borrower were to strike it rich within five of his or her post-college years -- which may not be entirely unrealistic, because royalty-based lenders have so far been highly selective in their approval processes -- the APR would double to 97 percent.<br />
<br />
So you might want to think twice before choosing an adjustable-rate mortgage at a time when interest rates are poised to increase, an equity-sharing deal when housing prices are on the upswing, or an income-sharing arrangement at the dawn of a promising career.<br />

<br />
SAN DIEGO -- Former presidential candidate <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Mitt+Romney/">Mitt Romney</a> and his wife passed another hurdle Friday in their plans to tear down their 1936 beachfront home in San Diego's affluent <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/homes-for-sale-listings/La-Jolla_CA">La Jolla </a>community and build an 11,000-square-foot mansion in its place. The California Coastal Commission voted 7-4 on Friday to allow the city-approved permit for the project, ruling that it did not pose a significant issue under the California Coastal Act, said the panel's legislative liaison Sarah Christie.<br />
<br />
The Romneys bought the 3,000-square-foot home in 2008 for $12 million. A former neighbor, Anthony Ciani, had challenged the city permit, saying it was granted because the Romneys exaggerated the size of the lot by claiming the beach in front. The commission ruled the Romneys do own that portion of beach. The commission also disagreed with Ciani that the mansion will be out of character with the surrounding upscale community. The commission's staff noted that the home has been altered throughout the years.<br />
<br />
The Romneys have submitted a plan for a 29-foot tall residence with attached four-car garage. Romneys' attorney, Matthew Peterson, told the Los Angeles Times, the couple would probably break ground on the project in six months, and that construction would take between 14 and 16 months.<br />

Romney sold a $5 million Deer Valley vacation house in 2009 before launching a presidential bid. His <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Mitt+Romney+homes/">main residence</a> has been in La Jolla and he owns a condominium in Belmont, Mass. The family has long owned a summer resort home in New Hampshire, and recently purchased two adjoining houses with horse barns in a Salt Lake City suburb.<br />

It's not uncommon for <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/celebrity+real+estate/">celebrities</a> to buy the properties next to their homes to ensure privacy, but usually when they do this, the neighboring homes are already on the market. But when you're <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Mark+Zuckerberg/">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml" target="_blank">worth $19 billion</a>, you can usually find a price that your neighbors would be willing to sell for. According to property records, the Facebook CEO recently spent $30 million to buy four of his neighbors' homes.

<figure class="photo-slim undefined"><img alt="Facebook Zuckerberg (Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during a " data-caption="Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during a " data-mep="14586" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/1920x2923+1453+168/resize/233x350!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://hss-prod.hss.aol.com/hss/storage/adam/7864aeeae280ff7942e9c64f622c671/d357538f77804805ad93178060aa809b.jpeg" /><figcaption class="cap">
<div style="text-align: right;"><b class="credit">AP</b></div>
</figcaption></figure>
Zuckerberg isn't taking over the properties, however. According to the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_24285169/zuckerberg-buys-four-houses-near-his-palo-alto" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>, the 29-year-old tech titan wants to be able to control how the properties surrounding his home (pictured above and below) are marketed and who they are sold to. He first began buying the homes in December 2012 after learning of a developer's plans to capitalize on Zuckerberg's residence in the area. "The developer was going to build a huge house and market the property as being next door to Mark Zuckerberg," a source told the Mercury News.<br />
<br />
Rather than risk a media firestorm, Zuckerberg spent the better part of the year buying three homes behind him and one next door. He is leasing the homes back to the former homeowners. The latest sale closed just this week, the Silicon Valley Business Journal reported.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.zillow.com/palo-alto-ca/" target="_blank">Silicon Valley real estate doesn't ever come cheap</a>: The <a href="http://www.zillow.com/local-info/CA-Palo-Alto-home-value/r_26374/" target="_blank">median home value in Palo Alto is $1.788 million</a> (up 21.1 percent year-over-year), and in Zuckerberg's neighborhood of Crescent Park,<a href="http://www.zillow.com/local-info/CA-Palo-Alto/Crescent-Park-home-value/r_343609/" target="_blank">the median home value is even higher at $3.062 million</a> (up 23.7 percent year-over-year). However, Zuckerberg spent far more than the estimated value of many of his neighbors' residences.<br />
<br />
According to Santa Clara County property records, one homeowner sold to Zuckerberg for $14 million. The home in question is just 2,600 square feet -- half the size of Zuckerberg's residence -- and valued at $3.171 million. By comparison, Zuckerberg paid <a href="http://www.zillowblog.com/2011-05-05/facebooks-zuckerberg-buys-palo-alto-home/">$7 million for his 5,000-square-foot home in May 2011</a>.<br />
<br />
The price tag isn't all that surprising, says <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/blog/tag/Silicon+Valley/">Silicon Valley</a> real estate agent Eric Boyenga of<a href="http://www.interorealestate.com/"> Intero Real Estate</a>. He confirms that <a href="http://realestate.aol.com/home-values-listings/Palo-Alto_CA">Palo Alto homes are always priced high</a>, especially larger parcels.<br />
"Larger parcels go at a premium," he said. "It's really supply and demand and how few of these parcels there are. The owners don't want to let them go at just any price."<br />
<br />
Zuckerberg's home currently is a smaller lot, and although he is purchasing the surrounding homes as a privacy investment, down the road, he may be able to expand his lot line -- and that in a limited market like Silicon Valley, is well worth $30 million.<br />
<br />
"I think people look at it like oh that's crazy, but for Zuckerberg to get to those parcels, to actually own them, it's worth it," said Boyenga.<br />
<br />
Zuckerberg also owns a home in San Francisco.<br />

<br />
A Florida family came home one night this week and were startled to see that their in-ground pool had popped up out of the soil. Now it turns out that that when it comes to covering the thousands to repair it, the insurance payment may be only a drop in the bucket.<br />
<br />
"We had this disastrous scene in the backyard," Brandon, Fla., homeowner Jessica Pedraza <a href="http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/story/23642408/2013/10/08/homeowner-in-disbelief-after-pool-pops-out-of-the-ground">told Fox 13 Tampa Bay</a>. She and her husband initially suspected that the problem might be a sinkhole, even though the pool, rather than sinking, was pushed up about three feet above ground (as pictured above and shown in the video below). The family in west central Florida soon discovered that because they had drained the pool the day before to clean it, groundwater beneath it swelled the soil, dislodging the pool and part of the patio.<br />
<br />
Pedraza thought her insurance company would cover the damage, the TV station reported, but instead it told her that the claim will likely be denied because of a clause in the policy that excludes damage caused by "water below the surface of the ground ... which exerts pressure on ... a swimming pool or other structure."<br />
<br />
Pedraza said the insurance company offered her $1,500, roughly the cost of sending out one of its engineers to determine if the damage was caused by groundwater. The total damage is likely to be at least $5,000 and could reach the tens of thousands, according to various news reports.<br />
<br />
"The insurance is not wanting to cover it by any means," she told another local station, <a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/news/local/homeowners-pool-pops-out-ground-insurance-wont-cov/nbKrm/">WFTV</a>. "You pay for an insurance policy assuming that you have coverage and the coverage isn't actually there when you go to file the claim."<br />
<br />
So what does homeowners insurance usually cover when it comes to pools?<br />
<br />
Homeowners insurance policies may cover any personal liability for personal injury to guests or visitors, however it would most likely provide very little coverage for damage to the swimming pool itself, writes Basil Housewright, manager of Texans Insurance &amp; Financial Group in Sugarland, Texas ( for the <a href="http://fbindependent.com/swimming-pools-and-your-home-insurance-p4399-89.htm">Fort Bend Independent)</a>.<br />
<br />
Damage that is usually covered to a backyard swimming pool would typically be from fire, wind, hurricane or hail -- standard coverage on a homeowners insurance policy -- but these are also acts that are least likely to cause damage to a concrete, in-ground pool, he said. "Most damage to the in-ground pools consists of cracking from ground movement or maintenance-type issues to pool equipment, which most likely will not be covered by a standard home insurance policy."<br />
<br />
The Hartford Financial Services insurance group says that coverage for "pop up" issues due to elevations in the water table can be covered if a homeowner adds on "specialized coverage," such as its "<a href="http://www.thehartford.com/business-insurance/pool-spa-liability-insurance">Pool &amp; Spa Insurance Program</a>."<br />

<br />
Many people are counting on the equity they have built in their home to help fund their retirement years. But folks who are living without quite enough saved for retirement should be realistic about what that equity can provide. Here are a few reasons to be cautious about relying on <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/home+equity/" target="_blank">home equity</a> to provide for you financially in retirement:<br />
<br />
<strong>Your spouse will still need a place to live</strong>. Some people assume they can use the proceeds of their house if they ever need to check themselves into a nursing home. But you can't sell your home for long-term care expenses when your significant other still needs a place to stay. Don't assume you will be living by yourself by the time long-term care is needed or that your spouse will need it at the same time. Plus, the equity in your home may not even be enough to cover the cost of a nursing home.<br />
<br />
<strong>The value of your home equity could change</strong>. Estimating how much equity you will have in your home if you ever need the money is just a guess. You might refinance in the future, and extend the date you will be totally debt free. House prices also tend to go up and down without warning. Plus, you'll never know how much it will cost you to extract equity from your home if you ever need the cash.<br />
<br />
<strong>Commissions and taxes will siphon off a big chunk of the value</strong>. The standard arrangement is asking the seller to pay the buy and sell realtors 6 percent of the final selling price. Then you have to contend with the possible capital gains taxes. Sure, $250,000 (or $500,000 for couples) of the gains can escape tax free, but <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation</a> will make these seemingly large numbers much smaller in a few decades when you actually need to sell. You might also want to put the house on the market well before you actually need the cash. If you wait until the last minute you may have to sell the property at fire-sale prices because you are in a hurry.<br />
<br />
<strong>Reverse mortgages can be very costly</strong>. Reverse mortgages allow you to continue to live in your home for the rest of your life while also getting some money, but you'll get far less than what your house is worth. The fees and <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/tag/interest+rates/" target="_blank">interest rates</a> for this type of loan are often rather high. Plus, if your circumstances change and you want or need to move, the loan becomes due. You may find years after taking out a reverse mortgage that you want to move out. If you don't live there for whatever reason, you'll need to start paying back that loan, which can be a huge strain on your budget.<br />
<br />
<strong>Downsizing will net you less cash than you probably think</strong>. Many people hope to downsize and use the left over equity to supplement their nest egg. This is a great strategy because not only will you get some equity, but the cost of upkeep at your smaller place is likely to be permanently reduced as well. But be realistic about how much money you'll gain from this maneuver. There are extra costs every time you move, so factor that into your calculations in addition to the commissions and taxes.<br />
<br />
Home equity can certainly be tapped in case of emergencies in retirement, but often works best as a last resort. No matter what, you'll always need a place to live.<br />
